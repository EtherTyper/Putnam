<h3><center>Russian Mathematical Olympiad</center></h3>

<p>

As far as I understand it, the competition has several rounds. Each round has problems at more than one level (typically for forms 9, 10 and 11) set on two days. Until 1993, there was no final round, because the leading competitors in the earlier rounds went through to the <b>All-Soviet Union</b> competition. Confusingly, the 1993 competition is called the 19th (so that the 1st was in 1975, rather than 1967 or 1961 as you might expect). That is because the system was reorganised in 1975. 

<p>

Here I intend to put up the problems from the final round (at all three levels). Sometimes the same problem is set at more than one level, so the exact number of problems varies from year to year. It is usually 20-24 a year. So far there are 172 problems in the archive.
