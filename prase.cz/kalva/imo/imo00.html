<b>A1.</b>&nbsp; AB is tangent to the circles CAMN and NMBD. M lies between C and D on the line CD, and CD is parallel to AB. The chords NA and CM meet at P; the chords NB and MD meet at Q. The rays CA and  DB meet at E. Prove that PE = QE.

<b>A3.</b>&nbsp; k is a positive real. N is an integer greater than 1. N points are placed on a line, not all coincident. A <i>move</i> is carried out as follows. Pick any two points A and B which are not coincident. Suppose that A lies to the right of B. Replace B by another point B' to the right of A such that AB' = k BA. For what values of k can we move the points arbitarily far to the right by repeated moves?

<b>B1.</b>&nbsp; 100 cards are numbered 1 to 100 (each card different) and placed in 3 boxes (at least one card in each box). How many ways can this be done so that if two boxes are selected and a card is taken from each, then the knowledge of their sum alone is always sufficient to identify the third box?

<b>B3.</b>&nbsp; A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>A<sub>3</sub> is an acute-angled triangle. The foot of the altitude from A<sub>i</sub> is K<sub>i</sub> and the incircle touches the side opposite A<sub>i</sub> at L<sub>i</sub>. The line K<sub>1</sub>K<sub>2</sub> is reflected in the line L<sub>1</sub>L<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, the line K<sub>2</sub>K<sub>3</sub> is reflected in L<sub>2</sub>L<sub>3</sub> and K<sub>3</sub>K<sub>1</sub> is reflected in L<sub>3</sub>L<sub>1</sub>. Show that the three new lines form a triangle with vertices on the incircle.
