<b>Problem A2</b>

<p>

Prove that there is a point D on the side AB of the triangle ABC, such that CD is the geometric mean of AD and DB if and only if sin A sin B &le; sin<sup>2</sup>(C/2)

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

Extend CD to meet the circumcircle of ABC at E. Then CD&middot;DE = AD&middot;DB, so CD is the geometric mean of AD and DB iff CD = DE. So we can find such a point iff the distance of C from AB is less than the distance of AB from the furthest point of the arc AB on the opposite side of AB to C. The furthest point F is evidently the midpoint of the arc AB. F lies on the angle bisector of C. So &ang;FAB = &ang;FAC = &ang;C/2. Hence distance of F from AB is c/2 tan C/2 (as usual we set c = AB, b = CA, a = BC). The distance of C from AB is a sin B. So a necessary and sufficient condition is c/2 tan C/2 &ge; a sin B. But by the sine rule, a = c sin A/sin C, so the condition becomes (sin C/2 sin C)/(2 cos C/2) &ge; sin A sin B. But sin C = 2 sin C/2 cos C/2, so we obtain the condition quoted in the question.
