<b>Problem B3</b><br>

<p>

Let P(x) be a polynomial with integer coefficients of degree d &gt; 0. Let n be the number of distinct integer roots to P(x) = 1 or -1. Prove that n &le; d + 2.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Suppose that A(x) and B(x) are two polynomials with integer coefficients which are identical except for their constant terms, which differ by 2. Suppose A(r) = 0, and B(s) =0 with r and s integers. Then subtracting we get 2 plus a sum of terms a(r<sup>i</sup> - s<sup>i</sup>). Each of these terms is divisible by (r - s), so 2 must be divisible by (r - s). Hence r and s differ by 0, 1 or 2.

<p>
Now let r be the smallest root of P(x) = 1 and P(x) = -1. The polynomial with r as a root can have at most d distinct roots and hence at most d distinct integer roots. If s is a root of the other equation then s must differ from r by 0, 1, or 2. But s &ge; r, so s = r, r+1 or r+2. Hence the other equation adds at most 2 distinct integer roots.
