<b>Problem B2</b>

<p>

An arbitrary point M is taken in the interior of the segment AB. Squares AMCD and MBEF are constructed on the same side of AB. The circles circumscribed about these squares, with centers P and Q, intersect at M and N.<br>

&nbsp; (a) prove that AF and BC intersect at N;<br>

&nbsp; (b) prove that the lines MN pass through a fixed point S (independent of M);<br>

&nbsp; (c) find the locus of the midpoints of the segments PQ as M varies.

<p>

(a) &nbsp; &ang;ANM = &ang;ACM = 45<sup>o</sup>. But &ang;FNM = &ang;FEM = 45<sup>o</sup>, so A, F, N are collinear. Similarly, &ang;BNM = &ang;BEM = 45<sup>o</sup> and &ang;CNM = 180<sup>o</sup> - &ang;CAM = 135<sup>o</sup>, so B, N, C are collinear.

<p>

(b) &nbsp; Since &ang;ANM = &ang;BNM = 45<sup>o</sup>, &ang;ANB = 90<sup>o</sup>, so N lies on the semicircle diameter AB. Let NM meet the circle diameter AB again at S. &ang;ANS = &ang;BNS implies AS = BS and hence S is a fixed point.

<p>

(c) &nbsp; Clearly the distance of the midpoint of PQ from AB is AB/4. Since it varies continuously with M, it must be the interval between the two extreme positions, so the locus is a segment length AB/2 centered over AB.<br>
