<b>Problem B3</b>

<p>

Given n &gt; 2 points in the plane, prove that at most n pairs of points are the maximum distance apart (of any two points in the set).

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

The key is that if two segments length d do not intersect then we can find an endpoint of one which is a distance &gt; d from an endpoint of the other.

<p>
Given this, the result follows easily by induction. If false for n, then there is a point A in three pairs AB, AC and AD of length d (the maximum distance). Take AC to lie between AB and AD. Now C cannot be in another pair. Suppose it was in CX. Then CX would have to cut both AB and AD, which is impossible.

<p>

To prove the result about the segments, suppose they are PQ and RS. We must have angle PQR less than 90<sup>o</sup>, otherwise PR &gt; PQ = d. Similarly, the other angles of the quadrilateral must all be less than 90<sup>o</sup>. Contradiction.
