<b>Problem A2</b>

<p>

Let P<sub>1</sub>(x) = x<sup>2</sup> - 2, and P<sub>i+1</sub> = P<sub>1</sub>(P<sub>i</sub>(x)) for i = 1, 2, 3, ... . Show that the roots of P<sub>n</sub>(x) = x are real and distinct for all n.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

We show that the graph of P<sub>n</sub> can be divided into 2<sup>n</sup> lines each joining the top and bottom edges of the square side 4 centered on the origin (vertices (2,2), (-2,2), (-2,-2), (-2,2) ). We are then home because the upward sloping diagonal of the square, which represents the graph of y = x, must cut each of these lines and hence give 2<sup>n</sup> distinct real roots of P<sub>n</sub>(x) = x in the range [-2,2]. But P<sub>n</sub> is a polynomial of degree 2<sup>n</sup>, so it has exactly 2<sup>n</sup> roots. Hence all its roots are real and distinct.

<p>
We prove the result about the graph by induction. It is true for n = 1: the first line is the graph from x = -2 to 0, and the second line is the graph from 0 to 2. So suppose it is true for n. Then P<sub>1</sub> turns each of the 2<sup>n</sup> lines for P<sub>n</sub> into two lines for P<sub>n+1</sub>, so the result is true for n+1.

<p>

Put x = 2 cos t (so we are restricting attention to -2 &le; x &le; 2). Then we find P<sub>n</sub>(x) = 2 cos 2<sup>n</sup>t, so the equation P<sub>n</sub>(x) = x becomes cos 2<sup>n</sup>t = cos t. By inspection, has the 2<sup>n</sup> solutions t = 2k&pi;/(2<sup>n</sup> - 1) and t = 2k&pi;/(2<sup>n</sup> + 1), giving 2<sup>n</sup> distinct solutions in x.
