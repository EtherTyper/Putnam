<b>Problem A2</b><br>

<p>

Let D be a point inside the acute-angled triangle ABC such that &ang;ADB = &ang;ACB + 90<sup>o</sup>, and AC&middot;BD = AD&middot;BC.

<p>(a)&nbsp; Calculate the ratio AB&middot;CD/(AC&middot;BD).

<p>(b)&nbsp; Prove that the tangents at C to the circumcircles of ACD and BCD are perpendicular.

Take B' so that CB = CB', &ang;BCB' = 90<sup>o</sup> and B' is on the opposite side of BC to A. It is easy to check that ADB, ACB' are similar and DAC, BAB' are similar. Hence AB/BD = AB'/B'C and CD/AC = BB'/AB'. It follows that the ratio given is BB'/B'C which is &radic;2.

<p>Take XD the tangent to the circumcircle of ADC at D, so that XD is in the &ang;ADB. Similarly, take YD the tangent to the circumcircle BDC at D. Then &ang;ADX = &ang;ACD, &ang;BDY = &ang;BCD, so &ang;ADX + &ang;BDY = &ang;ACB and hence &ang;XDY = &ang;ADB - (&ang;ADX + &ang;BDY) = &ang;ADB - &ang;ACB = 90<sup>o</sup>. In other words the tangents to the circumcircles at D are perpendicular. Hence, by symmetry (reflecting in the line of centers) the tangents at C are perpendicular.

<i>Theo Koupelis, University of Wisconsin, Marathon</i> &nbsp; provided a similar solution (about 10 minutes later!) taking the point B' so that &ang;BDB' = 90<sup>o</sup>, BD = B'D and &ang;B'DA = &ang;ACB. DAC, B'AB are similar; and ABC, AB'D are similar.

<p><i>Marcin Mazur, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</i> &nbsp; provided the first solution I received (about 10 minutes earlier!) using the generalized Ptolemy's equality (as opposed to the easier equality), but I do not know of a slick proof of this, so I prefer the proof above.
