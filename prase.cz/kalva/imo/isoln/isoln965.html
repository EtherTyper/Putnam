<b>Problem B2</b>

<p>

Let ABCDEF be a convex hexagon such that AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Let R<sub>A</sub>, R<sub>C</sub>, R<sub>E</sub> denote the circumradii of triangles FAB, BCD, DEF respectively, and let p denote the perimeter of the hexagon. Prove that:

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; R<sub>A</sub> + R<sub>C</sub> + R<sub>E</sub> &ge; p/2.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

The starting point is the formula for the circumradius R of a triangle ABC: 2R = a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C. [Proof: the side a subtends an angle 2A at the center, so a = 2R sin A.]

This gives that 2R<sub>A</sub> = BF/sin A, 2R<sub>C</sub> = BD/sin C, 2R<sub>E</sub> = FD/sin E. It is clearly not true in general that BF/sin A &gt; BA + AF, although it is true if angle FAB &ge; 120<sup>o</sup>, so we need some argument that involves the hexagon as a whole.

<p>
Extend sides BC and FE and take lines perpendicular to them through A and D, thus forming a rectangle. Then BF is greater than or equal to the side through A and the side through D. We may find the length of the side through A by taking the projections of BA and AF giving AB sin B + AF sin F. Similarly the side through D is CD sin C + DE sin E. Hence:

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2BF &ge; AB sin B + AF sin F + CD sin C + DE sin E.

&nbsp; Similarly:

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2BD &ge; BC sin B + CD sin D + AF sin A + EF sin E, and 

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2FD &ge; AB sin A + BC sin C + DE sin D + EF sin F.

<p>
Hence 2BF/sin A + 2BD/sin C + 2FD/sin E &ge; AB(sin A/sin E + sin B/sin A) + BC(sin B/sin C + sin C/sin E) + CD(sin C/sin A + sin D/sin C) + DE(sin E/sin A + sin D/sin E) + EF(sin E/sin C + sin F/sin E) + AF(sin F/sin A + sin A/sin C).

<p>
We now use the fact that opposite sides are parallel, which implies that opposite angles are equal: A = D, B = E, C = F. Each of the factors multiplying the sides in the last expression now has the form x + 1/x which has minimum value 2 when x = 1. Hence 2(BF/sin A + BD/sin C + FD/sin E) &ge; 2p and the result is proved.
