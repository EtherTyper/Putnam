<b>Problem A2</b><br>

<p>

Let P<sub>1</sub> be a convex polyhedron with vertices A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ... , A<sub>9</sub>. Let P<sub>i</sub> be the polyhedron obtained from P<sub>1</sub> by a translation that moves A<sub>1</sub> to A<sub>i</sub>. Prove that at least two of the polyhedra P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, ... , P<sub>9</sub> have an interior point in common.

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

The result is false for 8 vertices - for example, the cube. We get 8 cubes, with only faces in common, forming a cube 8 times as large. 

<p>This suggests a trick. Each P<sub>i</sub> is contained in D, the polyhedron formed from P<sub>1</sub> by doubling the scale. Take A<sub>1</sub> as the origin and take the vertex B<sub>i</sub> to have twice the coordinates of A<sub>i</sub>. Given a point X inside P<sub>1</sub>, the midpoint of P<sub>i</sub>X must lie in P<sub>1</sub> by convexity. Hence the point with doubled coordinates, which is obtained by adding the coordinates of A<sub>i</sub> to the coordinates of X, lies in D. In other words every point of P<sub>i</sub> lies in D. But the volume of D is 8 times the volume of P<sub>1</sub>, which is less than the sum of the volumes of P<sub>1</sub>, ... , P<sub>9</sub>.
