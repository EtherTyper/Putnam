<b>Problem B2</b>

<p>

Find 1975 points on the circumference of a unit circle such that the distance between each pair is rational, or prove it impossible.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

Let x be the angle cos<sup>-1</sup>4/5, so that cos x = 4/5, sin x = 3/5. Take points on the unit circle at angles 2nx for n integral. Then the distance between the points at angles 2nx and 2mx is 2 sin(n - m)x. The usual formula, giving sin(n - m)x in terms of sin x and cos x, shows that sin(n - m)x is rational. So it only remains to show that this process generates arbitarily many distinct points, in other words that x is not a rational multiple of &pi;.

<p>
This is quite hard. There is an elegant argument in sections 5 and 8 of Hadwiger et al, Combinatorial geometry in the Plane. But we can avoid it by observing that there are only finitely many numbers with are nth roots of unity for n &le; 2 x 1975, whereas there are infinitely many Pythagorean triples, so we simply pick a triple which is not such a root of unity.
