<b>Problem A1</b>

<p>

Find all integers a, b, c satisfying 1 &lt; a &lt; b &lt; c such that (a - 1)(b -1)(c - 1) is a divisor of abc - 1.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

Answer: a = 2, b = 4, c = 8; or a = 3, b = 5, c = 15.

<p>Let k = 2<sup>1/3</sup>. If a &ge; 5, then k(a - 1) &gt; a. [Check: (k(a - 1)<sup>3</sup> - a<sup>3</sup> = a<sup>3</sup> - 6a<sup>2</sup> + 6a - 2. For a &ge; 6, a<sup>3</sup> &ge; 6a<sup>2</sup> and 6a &gt; 2, so we only need to check a = 5: 125 - 150 + 30 - 2 = 3.] We know that c &gt; b &gt; a, so if a &ge; 5, then 2(a - 1)(b - 1)(c - 1) &gt; abc &gt; abc - 1. So we must have a = 2, 3 or 4.

<p>
Suppose abc - 1 = n(a - 1)(b - 1)(c - 1). We consider separately the cases n = 1, n = 2 and n &ge; 3. If n = 1, then a + b + c = ab + bc + ca. But that is impossible, because a, b, c are all greater than 1 and so a &lt; ab, b &lt; bc and c &lt; ca.

<p>
Suppose n = 2. Then abc - 1 is even, so all a, b, c are odd. In particular, a = 3. So we have 4(b - 1)(c - 1) = 3bc - 1, and hence bc + 5 = 4b + 4c. If b &gt;= 9, then bc &gt;= 9c &gt; 4c + 4b. So we must have b = 5 or 7. If b = 5, then we find c = 15, which gives a solution. If b = 7, then we find c = 23/3 which is not a solution.

<p>
The remaining case is n &gt;= 3. If a = 2, we have n(bc - b - c + 1) = 2bc - 1, or (n - 2)bc + (n + 1) = nb + nc. But b &ge; 3, so (n - 2)bc &ge; (3n - 6)c &ge; 2nc for n &ge; 6, so we must have n = 3, 4 or 5. If n = 3, then bc + 4 = 3b + 3c. If b &gt;= 6, then bc &ge; 6c &gt; 3b + 3c, so b = 3, 4 or 5. Checking we find only b = 4 gives a solution: a = 2, b = 4, c = 8. If n = 4, then (n - 2)bc, nb and nc are all even, but (n + 1) is odd, so there is no solution. If n = 5, then 3bc + 6 = 5b + 5c. b = 3 gives c = 9/4, which is not a solution. b &gt;= 4 gives 3bc &gt; 10c &gt; 5b + 5c, so there are no solutions.

<p>
If a = 3, we have 2n(bc - b - c + 1) = 3bc - 1, or (2n - 3)bc + (2n + 1) = 2nb + 2nc. But b &ge; 4, so (2n - 3)bc &ge; (8n - 12)c &ge; 4nc &gt; 2nc + 2nb. So there are no solutions. Similarly, if a = 4, we have (3n - 4)bc + (3n + 1) = 3nb + 3nc. But b &ge; 4, so (3n - 4)bc &ge; (12n - 16)c &gt; 6nc &gt; 3nb + 3nc, so there are no solutions.
