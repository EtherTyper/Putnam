<b>Problem B2</b>

<p>

Let ABCDEF be convex hexagon with AB = BC = CD and DE = EF = FA, such that &ang;BCD = &ang;EFA = 60<sup>o</sup>. Suppose that G and H are points in the interior of the hexagon such that &ang;AGB = &ang;DHE = 120<sup>o</sup>. Prove that AG + GB + GH + DH + HE &ge; CF.

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

BCD is an equilateral triangle and AEF is an equilateral triangle. The presence of equilateral triangles and quadrilaterals suggests using Ptolemy's inequality. [If this is unfamiliar, see <a href="../../soviet/ssoln/ssol616.html">ASU 61/6 solution</a>.]. From CBGD, we get CG&middot;BD &le; BG&middot;CD + GD&middot;CB, so CG &le; BG + GD. Similarly from HAFE we get HF &le; HA + HE. Also CF is shorter than the indirect path C to G to H to F, so CF &le; CG + GH + HF. But we do not get quite what we want. 

<p>

However, a slight modification of the argument does work. BAED is symmetrical about BE (because BA = BD and EA = ED). So we may take C' the reflection of C in the line BE and F' the reflection of F. Now C'AB and F'ED are still equilateral, so the same argument gives C'G &ge; AG + GB and HF' &le; DH + HE. So CF = C'F' &le; C'G + GH + HF' &le; AG + GB + GH + DH + HE.
