<b>Problem A3</b>

<p>

Determine all integers greater than 1 such that (2<sup>n</sup> + 1)/n<sup>2</sup> is an integer.

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

<i>by Gerhard W&ouml;ginger, Technical University, Graz</i>

<p>

Answer: n = 3.

<p>

Since 2<sup>n</sup> + 1 is odd, n must also be odd. Let p be its smallest prime divisor. Let x be the smallest positive integer such that 2<sup>x</sup> = -1 (mod p), and let y be the smallest positive integer such that 2<sup>y</sup> = 1 (mod p). y certainly exists and indeed y &lt; p, since 2<sup>p-1</sup> = 1 (mod p). x exists since 2<sup>n</sup> = -1 (mod p). Write n = ys + r, with 0 &le; r &lt; y. Then - 1 = 2<sup>n</sup> = (2<sup>y</sup>)<sup>s</sup>2<sup>r</sup> = 2<sup>r</sup> (mod p), so x &le; r &lt; y (r cannot be 0, since - 1 is not 1 (mod p) ).

<p>
Now write n = hx + k, with 0 &le; k &lt; x. Then -1 = 2<sup>n</sup> = (-1)<sup>h</sup>2<sup>k</sup> (mod p). Suppose k &gt; 0. Then if h is odd we contradict the minimality of y, and if h is even we contradict the minimality of x. So k = 0 and x divides n. But x &lt; p and p is the smallest prime dividing n, so x = 1. Hence 2 = -1 (mod p) and so p = 3.

<p>
Now suppose that 3<sup>m</sup> is the largest power of 3 dividing n. We show that m must be 1. Expand (3 - 1)<sup>n</sup> + 1 by the binomial theorem, to get (since n is odd): &nbsp; 1 - 1 + n.3 - 1/2 n(n - 1) 3<sup>2</sup> + ...  = 3n - (n - 1)/2 n 3<sup>2</sup> + ... . Evidently 3n is divisible by 3<sup>m+1</sup>, but not 3<sup>m+2</sup>. We show that the remaining terms are all divisible by 3<sup>m+2</sup>. It follows that 3<sup>m+1</sup> is the highest power 3 dividing 2<sup>n</sup> + 1. But 2<sup>n</sup>  + 1 is divisible by n<sup>2</sup> and hence by 3<sup>2m</sup>, so m must be 1.

<p>
The general term is (3<sup>m</sup>a)Cb 3<sup>b</sup>, for b &ge; 3. The binomial coefficients are integral, so the term is certainly divisible by 3<sup>m+2</sup> for b &ge; m+2. We may write the binomial coefficient as (3<sup>m</sup>a/b) (3<sup>m</sup> - 1)/1 (3<sup>m</sup> - 2)/2 (3<sup>m</sup> - 3)/3 ... (3<sup>m</sup> - (b-1)) / (b - 1). For b not a multiple of 3, the first term has the form 3<sup>m</sup> c/d, where 3 does not divide c or d, and the remaining terms have the form c/d, where 3 does not divide c or d. So if b is not a multiple of 3, then the binomial coefficient is divisible by 3<sup>m</sup>, since b &gt; 3, this means that the whole term is divisible by at least 3<sup>m+3</sup>. Similarly, for b a multiple of 3, the whole term has the same maximum power of 3 dividing it as 3<sup>m</sup> 3<sup>b</sup>/b. But b is at least 3, so 3<sup>b</sup>/b is divisible by at least 9, and hence the whole term is divisible by at least 3<sup>m+2</sup>.

<p>
We may check that n = 3 is a solution. If n &gt; 3, let n = 3 t and let q be the smallest prime divisor of t. Let w be the smallest positive integer for which 2<sup>w</sup> = -1 (mod q), and v the smallest positive integer for which 2<sup>v</sup> = 1 (mod q). v certainly exists and &lt; q since 2<sup>q-1</sup> = 1 (mod q). 2<sup>n</sup> = -1 (mod q), so w exists and, as before, w &lt; v. Also as before, we conclude that  w divides n. But w &lt; q, the smallest prime divisor of n, except 3. So w = 1 or 3. These do not work, because then 2 = -1 (mod q) and so q = 3, or 2<sup>3</sup> = -1 (mod q) and again q =3, whereas we know that q &gt; 3.
