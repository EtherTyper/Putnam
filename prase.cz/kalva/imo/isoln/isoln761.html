<b>Problem A1</b>

<p>

A plane convex quadrilateral has area 32, and the sum of two opposite sides and a diagonal is 16. Determine all possible lengths for the other diagonal.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

At first sight, the length of the other diagonal appears unlikely to be significantly constrained. However, a little experimentation shows that it is hard to get such a low value as 16. This suggests that 16 may be the smallest possible value.

<p>
If the diagonal which is part of the 16 has length x, then the area is the sum of the areas of two triangles base x, which is xy/2, where y is the sum of the altitudes of the two triangles. y must be at most (16 - x), with equality only if the two triangles are right-angled. But x(16 - x)/2 = (64 - (x - 8)<sup>2</sup>)/2 &le; 32 with equality only iff x = 8. Thus the only way we can achieve the values given is with one diagonal length 8 and two sides perpendicular to this diagonal with lengths totalling 8. But in this case the other diagonal has length 8&radic;2.
