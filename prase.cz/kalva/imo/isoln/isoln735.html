<b>Problem B2</b>

<p>

G is a set of non-constant functions f. Each f is defined on the real line and has the form f(x) = ax + b for some real a, b. If f and g are in G, then so is fg, where fg is defined by fg(x) = f(g(x)). If f is in G, then so is the inverse f<sup>-1</sup>. If f(x) = ax + b, then f<sup>-1</sup>(x) = x/a - b/a. Every f in G has a fixed point (in other words we can find x<sub>f</sub> such that f(x<sub>f</sub>) = x<sub>f</sub>. Prove that all the functions in G have a common fixed point.

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

f(x) = ax + b has fixed point b/(1-a). If a = 1, then b must be 0, and any point is a fixed point. So suppose f(x) = ax + b and g(x) = ax + b' are in G. Then h the inverse of f is given by h(x) = x/a - b/a, and hg(x) = x + b'/a - b/a. This is in G, so we must have b' = b.

<p>Suppose f(x) = ax + b, and g(x) = cx + d are in G. Then fg(x) = acx + (ad + b), and gf(x) = acx + (bc + d). We must have ad + b = bc + d and hence b/(1-a) = c/(1-d), in other words f and g have the same fixed point.
