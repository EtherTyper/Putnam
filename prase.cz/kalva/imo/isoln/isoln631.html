<b>Problem A1</b>

<p>

For which real values of p does the equation

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &radic;(x<sup>2</sup> - p) + 2 &radic;(x<sup>2</sup> - 1) = x have real roots? What are the roots?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

I must admit to having formed rather a dislike for this type of question which came up in almost every one of the early IMOs. Its sole purpose seems to be to teach you to be careful with one-way implications: the fact that a<sup>2</sup> = b<sup>2</sup> does not imply a = b.

<p>
The lhs is non-negative, so x must be non-negative. Moreover 2&radic;(x<sup>2</sup> - 1) &le; x, so x &le; 2/&radic;3. Also &radic;(x<sup>2</sup> - p) &le; x, so p &ge; 0.

<p>
Squaring etc gives that any solution must satisfy x<sup>2</sup> = (p - 4)<sup>2</sup>/(16 - 8p). We require x &le; 2/&radic;3 and hence (3p - 4)(p + 4) &le; 0, so p &le; 4/3.

<p>
Substituting back in the original equality we get |3p-4| + 2|p| = |p - 4|, which is indeed true for any p satisfying 0 &le; p &le; 4/3.
