<b>Problem B1</b>

<p>

In the triangle ABC, AB = AC. A circle is tangent internally to the circumcircle of the triangle and also to AB, AC at P, Q respectively. Prove that the midpoint of PQ is the center of the incircle of the triangle.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

It is not a good idea to get bogged down in complicated formulae for the various radii. The solution is actually simple.

<p>
By symmetry the midpoint, M, is already on the angle bisector of A, so it is sufficient to show it is on the angle bisector of B. Let the angle bisector of A meet the circumcircle again at R. AP is a tangent to the circle touching AB at P, so &ang;PRQ = &ang;APQ = &ang;ABC. Now the quadrilateral PBRM is cyclic because the angles PBR, PMR are both 90<sup>o</sup>. Hence &ang;PBM = &ang;PRM = (&ang;PRQ)/2, so BM does indeed bisect angle B as claimed.
