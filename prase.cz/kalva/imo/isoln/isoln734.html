<b>Problem B1</b><br>

<p>

A soldier needs to sweep a region with the shape of an equilateral triangle for mines. The detector has an effective radius equal to half the altitude of the triangle. He starts at a vertex of the triangle. What path should he follow in order to travel the least distance and still sweep the whole region?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

In particular he must sweep the other two vertices. Let us take the triangle to be ABC, with side 1 and assume the soldier starts at A. So the path must intersect the circles radius &radic;3/4 centered on the other two vertices. Let us look for the shortest path of this type. Suppose it intersects the circle center B at X and the circle center C at Y, and goes first to X and then to Y. Clearly the path from A to X must be a straight line and the path from X to Y must be a straight line. Moreover the shortest path from X to the circle center C follows the line XC and has length AX + XC - &radic;3/4. So we are looking for the point X which minimises AX + XC.

<p>
Consider the point P where the altitude intersects the circle. By the usual reflection argument the distance AP + PC is shorter than the distance AP' + P'C for any other point P' on the line perpendicular to the altitude through P. Moreover for any point X on the circle, take AX to cut the line at P'. Then AX + XC &gt; AP' + P'C &gt; AP + PC.

<p>
It remains to check that the three circles center A, X, Y cover the triangle. In fact the circle center X covers the whole triangle except for a small portion near A and a small portion near C, which are covered by the triangles center A and Y.
