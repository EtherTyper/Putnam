<b>Problem A3</b><br>

<p>

The tetrahedron ABCD is divided into two parts by a plane parallel to AB and CD. The distance of the plane from AB is k times its distance from CD. Find the ratio of the volumes of the two parts.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let the plane meet AD at X, BD at Y, BC at Z and AC at W. Take plane parallel to BCD through WX and let it meet AB in P.

<p>
Since the distance of AB from WXYZ is k times the distance of CD, we have that AX = k&middot;XD and hence that AX/AD = k/(k+1). Similarly AP/AB = AW/AC = AX/AD. XY is parallel to AB, so also AX/AD = BY/BD = BZ/BC.

<p>
vol ABWXYZ = vol APWX + vol WXPBYZ. APWX is similar to the tetrahedron ABCD. The sides are k/(k+1) times smaller, so vol APWX = k<sup>3</sup>(k+1)<sup>3</sup> vol ABCD. The base of the prism WXPBYZ is BYZ which is similar to BCD with sides k/(k+1) times smaller and hence area k<sup>2</sup>(k+1)<sup>2</sup> times smaller. Its height is 1/(k+1) times the height of A above ABCD, so vol prism = 3 k<sup>2</sup>(k+1)<sup>3</sup> vol ABCD. Thus vol ABWXYZ = (k<sup>3</sup> + 3k<sup>2</sup>)/(k+1)<sup>3</sup> vol ABCD. We get the vol of the other piece as vol ABCD - vol ABWXYZ and hence the ratio is (after a little manipulation) k<sup>2</sup>(k+3)/(3k+1).
