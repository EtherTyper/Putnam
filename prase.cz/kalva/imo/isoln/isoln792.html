<b>Problem A2</b>

<p>

A prism with pentagons A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>A<sub>3</sub>A<sub>4</sub>A<sub>5</sub> and B<sub>1</sub>B<sub>2</sub>B<sub>3</sub>B<sub>4</sub>B<sub>5</sub> as the top and bottom faces is given. Each side of the two pentagons and each of the 25 segments A<sub>i</sub>B<sub>j</sub> is colored red or green. Every triangle whose vertices are vertices of the prism and whose sides have all been colored has two sides of a different color. Prove that all 10 sides of the top and bottom faces have the same color.

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

We show first that the A<sub>i</sub> are all the same color. If not then, there is a vertex, call it A<sub>1</sub>, with edges A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>5</sub> of opposite color. Now consider the five edges A<sub>1</sub>B<sub>i</sub>. At least three of them must be the same color. Suppose it is green and that A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub> is also green. Take the three edges to be A<sub>1</sub>B<sub>i</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>B<sub>j</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>B<sub>k</sub>. Then considering the triangles A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>i</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>j</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>k</sub>, the three edges A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>i</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>j</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>k</sub> must all be red. Two of B<sub>i</sub>, B<sub>j</sub>, B<sub>k</sub> must be adjacent, but if the resulting edge is red then we have an all red triangle with A<sub>2</sub>, whilst if it is green we have an all green triangle with A<sub>1</sub>. Contradiction. So the A<sub>i</sub> are all the same color. Similarly, the B<sub>i</sub> are all the same color. It remains to show that they are the same color. Suppose otherwise, so that the A<sub>i</sub> are green and the B<sub>i</sub> are red.

<p>
Now we argue as before that 3 of the 5 edges A<sub>1</sub>B<sub>i</sub> must be the same color. If it is red, then as before 2 of the 3 B<sub>i</sub> must be adjacent and that gives an all red triangle with A<sub>1</sub>. So 3 of the 5 edges A<sub>1</sub>B<sub>i</sub> must be green. Similarly, 3 of the 5 edges A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>i</sub> must be green. But there must be a B<sub>i</sub> featuring in both sets and it forms an all green triangle with A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>. Contradiction. So the A<sub>i</sub> and the B<sub>i</sub> are all the same color.
