<b>Problem B3</b>

<p>

The function f is defined on the set of positive integers and its values are positive integers. Given that f(n+1) &gt; f(f(n)) for all n, prove that f(n) = n for all n.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

The first step is to show that f(1) &lt; f(2) &lt; f(3) &lt; ... . We do this by induction on n. We take S<sub>n</sub> to be the statement that f(n) is the unique smallest element of { f(n), f(n+1), f(n+2), ... }.

<p>
For m &gt; 1, f(m) &gt; f(s) where s = f(m-1), so f(m) is not the smallest member of the set {f(1), f(2), f(3), ... }. But the set is bounded below by zero, so it must have a smallest member. Hence the unique smallest member is f(1). So S<sub>1</sub> is true.

<p>
Suppose S<sub>n</sub> is true. Take m &gt; n+1. Then m-1 &gt; n, so by S<sub>n</sub>, f(m-1) &gt; f(n). But S<sub>n</sub> also tells us that f(n) &gt; f(n-1) &gt; ... &gt; f(1), so f(n) &ge; n - 1 + f(1) &ge; n. Hence f(m-1) &ge; n+1. So f(m-1) belongs to { n+1, n+2, n+3, .. }. But we are given that f(m) &gt; f(f(m-1)), so f(m) is not the smallest element of { f(n+1), f(n+2), f(n+3), ... }. But there must be a smallest element, so f(n+1) must be the unique smallest member, which establishes S<sub>n+1</sub>. So, S<sub>n</sub> is true for all n.

<p>
So n &le; m implies f(n) &lt;= f(m). Suppose for some m, f(m) &ge; m+1, then f(f(m)) &ge; f(m+1). Contradiction. Hence f(m) &le; m for all m. But since f(1) &ge;1 and f(m) &gt; f(m-1) &gt; ... &gt; f(1), we also have f(m) &ge; m. Hence f(m) = m for all m.
