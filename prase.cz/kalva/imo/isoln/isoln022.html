<b>Problem A2</b><br>

<p>

BC is a diameter of a circle center O. A is any point on the circle with angle AOC &gt; 60<sup>o</sup>. EF is the chord which is the perpendicular bisector of AO. D is the midpoint of the minor arc AB. The line through O parallel to AD meets AC at J. Show that J is the incenter of triangle CEF.

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

<p>

F is equidistant from A and O. But OF = OA, so OFA is equilateral and hence angle AOF = 60<sup>o</sup>. Since angle AOC &gt; 60<sup>o</sup>, F lies between A and C. Hence the ray CJ lies between CE and CF. 

<p>

D is the midpoint of the arc AB, so angle DOB = &frac12; angle AOB = angle ACB. Hence DO is parallel to AC. But OJ is parallel to AD, so AJOD is a parallelogram. Hence AJ = OD. So AJ = AE = AF, so J lies on the opposite side of EF to A and hence on the same side as C. So J must lie inside the triangle CEF. 

<p>

Also, since EF is the perpendicular bisector of AO, we have AE = AF = OE, so A is the center of the circle through E, F and J. Hence angle EFJ = &frac12; angle EAJ. But angle EAJ = angle EAC (same angle) = angle EFC. Hence J lies on the bisector of angle EFC.

<p>

Since EF is perpendicular to AO, A is the midpoint of the arc EF. Hence angle ACE = angle ACF, so J lies on the bisector of angle ECF. Hence J is the incenter.

<p>

<i>Many thanks to Dirk Laurie for pointing out that the original version of this solution failed to show the relevance of angle AOC &gt; 60<sup>o</sup>. According to the official marking scheme, one apparently lost a mark for failing to show J lies inside CEF.</i>
