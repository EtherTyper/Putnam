<b>Problem A2</b>

<p>

Take r such that 1 &le; r &le; n, and consider all subsets of r elements of the set {1, 2, ... , n}. Each subset has a smallest element. Let F(n,r) be the arithmetic mean of these smallest elements. Prove that:

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; F(n,r) = (n+1)/(r+1).

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

Denote the binomial coefficient n!/(r!(n-r)!) by nCr.

<p>
Evidently nCr F(n,r) = 1 (n-1)C(r-1) + 2 (n-2)C(r-1) + ... + (n-r+1) (r-1)C(r-1). [The first term denotes the contribution from subsets with smallest element 1, the second term smallest element 2 and so on.]

<p>
Let the rhs be g(n,r). Then, using the relation (n-i)C(r-1) - (n-i-1)C(r-2) = (n-i-1)C(r-1), we find that g(n,r) - g(n-1,r-1) = g(n-1,r), and we can extend this relation to r=1 by taking g(n,0) = n+1 = (n+1)C1. But g(n,1) = 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2 = (n+1)C2. So it now follows by an easy induction that g(n,r) = (n+1)C(r+1) = nCr (n+1)/(r+1). Hence F(n,r) = (n+1)/(r+1).

<p>

<i>A more elegant solution by Oliver Nash is as follows</i>

<p>

Let k be the smallest element. We want to evaluate g(n, r) = &sum;<sub>k=1 to n-r+1</sub> k &nbsp; (n-k)C(r-1). Consider the subsets with r+1 elements taken from 1, 2, 3, ... , n+1. Suppose k+1 is the second smallest element. Then there are k &nbsp; (n-k)C(r-1) possible subsets. So g(n, r) = (n+1)C(r+1). Hence F(n, r) = (n+1)C(r+1) / nCr = (n+1)/(r+1), as required.
