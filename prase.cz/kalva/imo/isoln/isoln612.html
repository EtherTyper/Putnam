<b>Problem A2</b>

<p>

Let a, b, c be the sides of a triangle and A its area. Prove that:

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> &ge; 4&radic;3 A

<p>

When do we have equality?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

One approach is a routine slog from Heron's formula. The inequality is quickly shown to be equivalent to a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>a<sup>2</sup> &le; a<sup>4</sup> + b<sup>4</sup> + c<sup>4</sup>, which is true since a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup> &le; (a<sup>4</sup> + b<sup>4</sup>)/2. We get equality iff the triangle is equilateral.

<p>

Another approach is to take an altitude lying inside the triangle. If it has length h and divides the base into lengths r and s, then we quickly find that the inequality is equivalent to (h - (r + s)&radic;3/2)<sup>2</sup> + (r - s)<sup>2</sup> &ge; 0, which is true. We have equality iff r = s and h = (r + s)&radic;3/2, which means the triangle is equilateral.

<p>

<i>A third solution is due to Jonathan Mizrahi (somewhat adapted):</i>

<p>

We have b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> &gt;= 2bc with equality iff b = c. Also for any angle x in the range 0<sup>o</sup> to 180<sup>o</sup> we have 2bc &ge; 2bc sin(X + 30<sup>o</sup>) with equality iff X = 60<sup>o</sup>. So taking X to be the angle between the sides b and c (we cannot call it A because A is already used to mean the area in this question!) we have that b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> &ge; bc sin(X + 30<sup>o</sup>) with equality iff the triangle is equilateral. Now 2 sin(X + 30<sup>o</sup>) = &radic;3 sin X + cos X, so using the cosine rule a<sup>2</sup> = b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> - 2bc cos X, we get the required inequality.
