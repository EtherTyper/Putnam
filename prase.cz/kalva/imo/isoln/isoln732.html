<b>Problem A2</b><br>

<p>

Can we find a finite set of non-coplanar points, such that given any two points, A and B, there are two others, C and D, with the lines AB and CD parallel and distinct?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

To warm up, we may notice that a regular hexagon is a planar set satisfying the condition. 

<p>Take two regular hexagons with a common long diagonal and their planes perpendicular. Now if we take A, B in the same hexagon, then we can find C, D in the same hexagon. If we take A in one and B in the other, then we may take C at the opposite end of a long diagonal from A, and D at the opposite end of a long diagonal from B.
