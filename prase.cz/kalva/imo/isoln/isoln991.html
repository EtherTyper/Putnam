<b>Problem A1</b>

<p>

Find all finite sets S of at least three points in the plane such that for all distinct points A, B in S, the perpendicular bisector of AB is an axis of symmetry for S.

<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<i>by Gerhard Woeginger</i>

<p>

<p>The possible sets are just the regular n-gons (n &gt; 2).

<p>

Let A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ... , A<sub>k</sub> denote the vertices of the convex hull of S (and take indices mod k as necessary). We show first that these form a regular k-gon. A<sub>i+1</sub> must lie on the perpendicular bisector of A<sub>i</sub> and A<sub>i+2</sub> (otherwise its reflection would lie outside the hull). Hence the sides are all equal. Similarly, A<sub>i+1</sub> and A<sub>i+2</sub> must be reflections in the perpendicular bisector of A<sub>i</sub> and A<sub>i+3</sub> (otherwise one of the reflections would lie outside the hull). Hence all the angles are equal. 

<p>Any axis of symmetry for S must also be an axis of symmetry for the A<sub>i</sub>, and hence must pass through the center C of the regular k-gon. Suppose X is a point of S in the interior of k-gon. Then it must lie inside or on some triangle A<sub>i</sub>A<sub>i+1</sub>C. C must be the circumcenter of A<sub>i</sub>A<sub>i+1</sub>X (since it lies on the three perpendicular bisectors, which must all be axes of symmetry of S), so X must lie on the circle center C, through A<sub>i</sub> and A<sub>i+1</sub>. But all points of the triangle A<sub>i</sub>A<sub>i+1</sub>X lie strictly inside this circle, except A<sub>i</sub>and A<sub>i+1</sub>, so X cannot be in the interior of the k-gon.
