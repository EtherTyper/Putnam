<b>Problem B3</b>

<p>

Given four distinct parallel planes, prove that there exists a regular tetrahedron with a vertex on each plane.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

Intuitively, we can place A and B on the two outer planes with AB perpendicular to the planes. Then tilt AB in one direction until we bring C onto one of the middle planes (keeping A and B on the outer planes), then tilt AB the other way (keeping A, B, C on their respective planes) until D gets onto the last plane.

<p>
Take A as the origin. Let the vectors AB, AC, AD be <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>. Take p as one of the outer planes. Let the distances to the other planes be e, f, g. Now we find a vector <b>n</b> satisfying: <b>n.b</b> = e, <b>n.c</b> = f, <b>n.d</b> = g. This is a system of three equations in three unknowns with non-zero determinant (because <b>b.c x d</b> is non-zero), so it has a solution <b>n</b>. Scale the tetrahedron by |<b>n</b>|, orient p perpendicular to <b>n</b>/|<b>n</b>|, then B, C, D will be on the other planes as required.
