<b>Problem B2</b>

<p>

Prove that for each positive integer n there exist n consecutive positive integers none of which is a prime or a prime power.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

Consider (N!)<sup>2</sup>+2, (N!)<sup>2</sup>+3, ... , (N!)<sup>2</sup>+N. (N!)<sup>2</sup>+r is divisible by r, but ((N!)<sup>2</sup>+r)/r = N! (N!/r) + 1, which is greater than one, but relatively prime to r since N! (N!/r) is divisible by r. For each r we may take a prime p<sub>r</sub> dividing r, so (N!)<sup>2</sup>+r is divisible by p<sub>r</sub>, but is not a power of p<sub>r</sub>. Hence it is not a prime or a prime power. Taking N = n+1 gives n consecutive numbers as required.
