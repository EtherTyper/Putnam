<b>Problem B2</b>

<p>

Prove that for every positive integer m we can find a finite set S of points in the plane, such that given any point A of S, there are exactly m points in S at unit distance from A.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

Take a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ... , a<sub>m</sub> to be points a distance 1/2 from the origin O. Form the set of 2<sup>m</sup> points &plusmn;a<sub>1</sub> &plusmn;a<sub>2</sub> &plusmn; ... &plusmn;a<sub>m</sub>. Given such a point, it is at unit distance from the m points with just one coefficient different. So we are home, provided that we can choose the a<sub>i</sub> to avoid any other pairs of points being at unit distance, and to avoid any degeneracy (where some of the 2<sup>m</sup> points coincide).

<p>
The distance between two points in the set is |c<sub>1</sub>a<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub>a<sub>2</sub> + ... + c<sub>m</sub>a<sub>m</sub>|, where c<sub>i</sub> = 0, 2 or -2. So let us choose the a<sub>i</sub> inductively. Suppose we have already chosen up to m. The constraints on a<sub>m+1</sub> are that we do not have |c<sub>1</sub>a<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub>a<sub>2</sub> + ... + c<sub>m</sub>a<sub>m</sub> + 2a<sub>m+1</sub>| equal to 0 or 1 for any c<sub>i</sub> = 0, 2 or -2, apart from the trivial cases of all c<sub>i</sub> = 0. Each | | = 0 rules out a single point and each | | = 1 rules out a circle which intersects the circle radius 1/2 about the origin at 2 points and hence rules out two points. So the effect of the constraints is to rule out a finite number of points, whereas we have uncountably many to choose from.
