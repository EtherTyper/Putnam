<b>Problem A2</b>

<p>

ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB = AC. M is the midpoint of BC and O is the point on the line AM such that OB is perpendicular to AB. Q is an arbitrary point on BC different from B and C. E lies on the line AB and F lies on the line AC such that E, Q, F are distinct and collinear. Prove that OQ is perpendicular to EF if and only if QE = QF.

<p>

Assume OQ is perpendicular to EF. Then &ang;EBO = &ang;EQO = 90<sup>o</sup>, so EBOQ is cyclic. Hence &ang;OEQ = &ang;OBQ. Also &ang;OQF = &ang;OCF = 90<sup>o</sup>, so OQCF is cyclic. Hence &ang;OFQ = &ang;OCQ. But &ang;OCQ = &ang;OBQ since ABC is isosceles. Hence &ang;OEQ = &ang;OFQ, so OE = OF, so triangles OEQ and OFQ are congruent and QE = QF.

<p>
Assume QE = QF. If OQ is not perpendicular to EF, then take E'F' through Q perpendicular to OQ with E' on AB and F' on AC. Then QE' = QF', so triangles QEE' and QFF' are congruent. Hence &ang;QEE' = &ang;QFF'. So CA and AB make the same angles with EF and hence are parallel. Contradiction. So OQ is perpendicular to EF.
