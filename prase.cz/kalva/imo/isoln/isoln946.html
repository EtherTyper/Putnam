<b>Problem B3</b>

<p>

Show that there exists a set A of positive integers with the following property: for any infinite set S of primes, there exist two positive integers m in A and n not in A, each of which is a product of k distinct elements of S for some k &ge; 2.

<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

Let the primes be p<sub>1</sub> &lt; p<sub>2</sub> &lt; p<sub>3</sub> &lt; ... . Let A consists of all products of n distinct primes such that the smallest is greater than p<sub>n</sub>. For example: all primes except 2 are in A; 21 is not in A because it is a product of two distinct primes and the smallest is greater than 3. Now let S = {p<sub>i<sub>1</sub></sub>, p<sub>i<sub>2</sub></sub>, ... } be any infinite set of primes. Assume that p<sub>i<sub>1</sub></sub> &lt; p<sub>i<sub>2</sub></sub> &lt; ... . Let n = i<sub>1</sub>. Then p<sub>i<sub>1</sub></sub>p<sub>i<sub>2</sub></sub> ... p<sub>i<sub>n</sub></sub> is not in A because it is a product of n distinct primes, but the smallest is not greater than p<sub>n</sub>. But p<sub>i<sub>2</sub></sub>p<sub>i<sub>3</sub></sub> ... p<sub>i<sub>n+1</sub></sub> is in A, because it is a product of n distinct primes and the smallest is greater than p<sub>n</sub>. But both numbers are products of n distinct elements of S.
