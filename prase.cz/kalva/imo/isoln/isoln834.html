<b>Problem B1</b>

<p>

Let ABC be an equilateral triangle and E the set of all points contained in the three segments AB, BC and CA (including A, B and C). Determine whether, for every partition of E into two disjoint subsets, at least one of the two subsets contains the vertices of a right-angled triangle.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

It does.

<p>Suppose otherwise, that E is the disjoint union of e and e' with no right-angled triangles in either set. Take points X, Y, Z two-thirds of the way along BC, CA, AB respectively (so that BX/BC = 2/3 etc). Then two of X, Y, Z must be in the same set. Suppose X and Y are in e. Now YX is perpendicular to BC, so all points of BC apart from X must be in e'. Take W to be the foot of the perpendicular from Z to BC. Then B and W are in e', so Z must be in e. ZY is perpendicular to AC, so all points of AC apart from Y must be in e'. e' is now far too big. For example let M be the midpoint of BC, then AMC is in e' and right-angled.
