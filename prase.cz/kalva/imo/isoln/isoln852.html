<b>Problem A2</b>

<p>

Let n and k be relatively prime positive integers with k &lt; n. Each number in the set M = {1, 2, 3, ... , n-1} is colored either blue or white. For each i in M, both i and n-i have the same color. For each i in M not equal to k, both i and |i-k| have the same color. Prove that all numbers in M must have the same color.

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

n and k are relatively prime, so 0, k, 2k, ... , (n-1)k form a complete set of residues mod n. So k, 2k, ... , (n-1)k are congruent to the numbers 1, 2, ... , n-1 in some order. Suppose ik is congruent to r and (i+1)k is congruent to s. Then either s = r + k, or s = r + k - n. If s = r + k, then we have immediately that r = s - k and s have the same color. If s = r + k - n, then r = n - (k - s), so r has the same color as k - s, and k - s has the same color as s. So in any case r and s have the same color. By giving i values from 1 to n-2 this establishes that all the numbers have the same color.
