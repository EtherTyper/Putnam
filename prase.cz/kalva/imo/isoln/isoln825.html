<b>Problem B2</b>

<p>

The diagonals AC and CE of the regular hexagon ABCDEF are divided by inner points M and N respectively, so that:

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AM/AC = CN/CE = r.

<p>Determine r if B, M and N are collinear.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

For an inelegant solution one can use coordinates. The advantage of this type of approach is that it is quick and guaranteed to work! Take A as (0,&radic;3), B as (1,&radic;3), C as (3/2,&radic;3/2, D as (1,0). Take the point X, coordinates (x,0), on ED. We find where the line BX cuts AC and CE. The general point on BX is (k + (1-k)x,k&radic;3). If this is also the point M with AM/AC = r then we have: k + (1-k)x = 3r/2, k&radic;3 = (1-r)&radic;3 + r&radic;3/2. Hence k = 1 - r/2, r = 2/(4-x). Similarly, if it is the point N with CN/CE = r, then k + (1-k)x = 3(1-r)/2, k&radic;3 = (1-r)&radic;3/2. Hence k = (1-r)/2 and r = (2-x)/(2+x). Hence for the ratios to be equal we require 2/(4-x) = (2-x)/(2+x), so x<sup>2</sup> - 8x + 4 = 0. We also have x &lt; 1, so x = 4 - &radic;12. This gives r = 1/&radic;3.

<p>
A more elegant solution uses the ratio theorem for the triangle EBC. We have CM/MX XB/BE EN/NC = -1. Hence (1-r)/(r - 1/2) (-1/4) (1-r)/r = -1. So r = 1/&radic;3.
