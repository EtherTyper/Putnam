<b>Problem A1</b>

<p>

Prove that the set {1, 2, ... , 1989} can be expressed as the disjoint union of subsets A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ... , A<sub>117</sub> in such a way that each A<sub>i</sub> contains 17 elements and the sum of the elements in each A<sub>i</sub> is the same.

<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

<p>We construct 116 sets of three numbers. Each set sums to 3 x 995 = 2985. The 348 numbers involved form 174 pairs {r, 1990 - r}. At this point we are essentially done. We take a 117th set which has one {r, 1990 - r} pair and 995. The original 1989 numbers comprise 995 and 994 {r, 1990 - r} pairs. We have used up 995 and 175 pairs, leaving just 819 pairs. We now add 7 pairs to each of our 117 sets, bringing the total of each set up to 2985 + 7.1990 = 1990 x 17/2.

<p>
It remains to exhibit the 116 sets. There are many possibilities. We start with:

<br>301, 801, 1883 and the "complementary" set 1990 - 301 = 1689, 1990 - 801 = 1189, 1990 - 1883 = 107. We then add one to each of the first two numbers to get:

<br>302, 802, 1881 and 1688, 1188, 109, and so on:

<br>303, 803, 1879 and 1687, 1187, 111,

<br> ...

<br>358, 858, 1769 and 1632, 1132, 221.

<br>We can immediately see that these triples are all disjoint. So the construction is complete.
