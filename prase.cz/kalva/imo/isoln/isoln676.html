<b>Problem B3</b>

<p>

In a sports contest a total of m medals were awarded over n days. On the first day one medal and 1/7 of the remaining medals were awarded. On the second day two medals and 1/7 of the remaining medals were awarded, and so on. On the last day, the remaining n medals were awarded. How many medals were awarded, and over how many days?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

Let the number of medals remaining at the start of day r be m<sub>r</sub>. Then m<sub>1</sub> = m, and 6(m<sub>k</sub> - k)/7 = m<sub>k+1</sub> for k &lt; n with m<sub>n</sub> = n.

<p>After a little rearrangement, we find that m = 1 + 2(7/6) + 3(7/6)<sup>2</sup> + ... + n(7/6)<sup>n-1</sup>. Summing, we get m = 36(1 - (n + 1)(7/6)<sup>n</sup> + n (7/6)<sup>n+1</sup>) = 36 + (n - 6)7<sup>n</sup>/6<sup>n-1</sup>. 6 and 7 are coprime, so 6<sup>n-1</sup> must divide n - 6. But 6<sup>n-1</sup> &gt; n - 6, so n = 6 and m = 36.
