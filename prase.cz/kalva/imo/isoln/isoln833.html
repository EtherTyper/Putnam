<b>Problem A3</b>

<p>

Let a , b and c be positive integers, no two of which have a common divisor greater than 1. Show that 2abc - ab - bc - ca is the largest integer which cannot be  expressed in the form xbc + yca + zab, where x, y, z are non-negative integers.

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

We start with the lemma that bc - b - c is the largest number which cannot be written as mb + nc with m and n non-negative. [Proof: 0, c, 2c, ... , (b-1)c is a complete set of residues mod b. If r &gt; (b-1)c - b, then r = nc (mod b) for some 0 &le; n &le; b-1. But r &gt; nc - b, so r = nc + mb for some m &ge; 0. That proves that every number larger than bc - b - c can be written as mb + nc with m and n non-negative. Now consider bc - b - c. It is (b-1)c (mod b), and not congruent to any nc with 0 &le; n &lt; b-1. So if bc - b - c = mb + nc, then n &ge; b-1. Hence mb + nc &ge; nc &ge; (b-1)c &gt; bc - b - c. Contradiction.]

<p>
0, bc, 2bc, ... , (a-1)bc is a complete set of residues mod a. So given N &gt; 2abc - ab - bc - ca we may take xbc = N (mod a) with 0 &lt;= x &lt; a. But N - xbc &gt; 2abc - ab - bc - ca - (a-1)bc = abc - ab - ca = a(bc - b - c). So N - xbc = ka, with k &gt; bc - b - c. Hence we can find non-negative y, z so that k = zb + yc. Hence N = xbc + yca + zab.

<p
>Finally, we show that for N = 2abc - ab - bc - ca we cannot find non-negative x, y, z so that N = xbc + yca + zab. N = -bc (mod a), so we must have x = -1 (mod a) and hence x &ge; a-1. Similarly, y &ge; b-1, and z &ge; c-1. Hence xbc + yca + zab &ge; 3abc - ab - bc - ca &gt; N. Contradiction.
