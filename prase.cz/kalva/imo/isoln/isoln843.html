<b>Problem A3</b>

<p>

Given points O and A in the plane. Every point in the plane is colored with one of a finite number of colors. Given a point X in the plane, the circle C(X) has center O and radius OX + (&ang;AOX)/OX, where &ang;AOX is measured in radians in the range [0, 2&pi;). Prove that we can find a point X, not on OA, such that its color appears on the circumference of the circle C(X).

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

Suppose the result is false. Let C<sup>1</sup> be any circle center O. Then the locus of points X such that C(X) = C<sub>1</sub> is a spiral from O to the point of intersection of OA and C<sub>1</sub>. Every point of this spiral must be a different color from all points of the circle C<sub>1</sub>. Hence every circle center O with radius smaller than C<sub>1</sub> must include a point of different color to those on C<sub>1</sub>. Suppose there are n colors. Then by taking successively smaller circles C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, ... , C<sub>n+1</sub> we reach a contradiction, since each circle includes a point of different color to those on any of the larger circles.
