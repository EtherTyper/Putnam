<b>Problem B1</b>

<p>

Prove that if n is a positive integer such that the equation

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; x<sup>3</sup> - 3xy<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>3</sup> = n

<p>has a solution in integers x, y, then it has at least three such solutions. Show that the equation has no solutions in integers for n = 2891.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

If x, y is a solution then so is y-x, -x. Hence also -y, x-y. If the first two are the same, then y = -x, and x = y-x = -2x, so x = y = 0, which is impossible, since n &gt; 0. Similarly, if any other pair are the same.

<p>
2891 = 2 (mod 9) and there is no solution to x<sup>3</sup> - 3xy<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>3</sup> = 2 (mod 9). The two cubes are each -1, 0 or 1, and the other term is 0, 3 or 6, so the only solution is to have the cubes congruent to 1 and -1 and the other term congruent to 0. But the other term cannot be congruent to 0, unless one of x, y is a multiple of 3, in which case its cube is congruent to 0, not 1 or -1.
