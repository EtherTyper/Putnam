<b>A1.</b>&nbsp; Chords AB and CD of a circle intersect at a point E inside the circle. Let M be an interior point of the segment EB. The tangent at E to the circle through D, E and M intersects the lines BC and AC at F and G respectively. Find EF/EG in terms of t = AM/AB.

<b>A2.</b>&nbsp; Take n &ge; 3 and consider a set E of 2n-1 distinct points on a circle. Suppose that exactly k of these points are to be colored black. Such a coloring is "good" if there is at least one pair of black points such that the interior of one of the arcs between them contains exactly n points from E. Find the smallest value of k so that every such coloring of k points of E is good.
