<b>A1.</b>&nbsp; Let d be any positive integer not equal to 2, 5 or 13. Show that one can find distinct a, b in the set {2, 5, 13, d} such that ab - 1 is not a perfect square.

<b>A2.</b>&nbsp; Given a point P<sub>0</sub> in the plane of the triangle A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>A<sub>3</sub>. Define A<sub>s</sub> = A<sub>s-3</sub> for all s &gt;= 4. Construct a set of points P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>, ... such that P<sub>k+1</sub> is the image of P<sub>k</sub> under a rotation center A<sub>k+1</sub> through an angle 120<sup>o</sup> clockwise for k = 0, 1, 2, ... . Prove that if P<sub>1986</sub> = P<sub>0</sub>, then the triangle A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>A<sub>3</sub> is equilateral.

<b>A3.</b>&nbsp; To each vertex of a regular pentagon an integer is assigned, so that the sum of all five numbers is positive. If three consecutive vertices are assigned the numbers x, y, z respectively, and y &lt; 0, then the following operation is allowed: x, y, z are replaced by x + y, -y, z + y respectively. Such an operation is performed repeatedly as long as at least one of the five numbers is negative. Determine whether this procedure necessarily comes to an end after a finite number of steps.

<b>B1.</b>&nbsp; Let A, B be adjacent vertices of a regular n-gon (n &ge; 5) with center O. A triangle XYZ, which is congruent to and initially coincides with OAB, moves in the plane in such a way that Y and Z each trace out the whole boundary of the polygon, with X remaining inside the polygon. Find the locus of X.

<b>B3.</b>&nbsp; Given a finite set of points in the plane, each with integer coordinates, is it always possible to color the points red or white so that for any straight line L parallel to one of the coordinate axes the difference (in absolute value) between the numbers of white and red points on L is not greater than 1?
