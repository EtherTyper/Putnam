<i>By Johannes Tang  Lek Huo</i>

<p>This is actually a disappointment to many, I suppose. This book is <i>very light</i> on Geometry, which is an important part of Olympiad competitions. However, it gives the novice some insights into combinatorics. Its coverage of Number Theory is atrocious. And I have expected the book to define <i>injective, surjective, bijective</i>. The book is far too thin to give complete exposure to beginners.
