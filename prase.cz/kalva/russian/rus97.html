<b>3.</b>&nbsp; A rectangular box has integral sides a, b, c, with c odd. Its surface is covered with pieces of rectangular cloth. Each piece contains an even number of unit squares and has its sides parallel to edges of the box. The pieces may be bent along box  edges length c (but not along the edges length a or b), but there must be no gaps and no part of the box may be covered by more than one thickness of cloth. Prove that the number of possible coverings is even.

<b>4.</b>&nbsp; The members of the Council of the Wise are arranged in a column. The king gives each sage a black or a white cap. Each sage can see the color of the caps of all the sages in front of him, but he cannot see his own or the colors of those behind him. Every minute a sage guesses the color of his cap. The king immediately executes those sages who are wrong. The Council agree on a strategy to minimise the number of executions. What is the best strategy? Suppose there are three colors of cap?
