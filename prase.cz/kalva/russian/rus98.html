<b>4.</b>&nbsp; A maze is a chessboard with walls between some squares. A piece responds to the commands left, right, up, down by moving one square in the indicated direction (parallel to the sides of the board), unless it meets a wall or the edge of the board, in which case it does not move. Is there a universal sequence of moves so that however the maze is constructed and whatever the initial position of the piece, by following the sequence it will visit every square of the board. You should assume that a maze must be constructed, so that some sequence of commands would allow the piece to visit every square.

<b>23.</b>&nbsp; A figure is made out of unit squares joined along their sides. It has the property that if the squares of an m x n rectangle are filled with real numbers with positive sum, then the figure can be placed over the rectangle (possibly after being rotated, but with each square of the figure coinciding with a square of the rectangle) so that the sum of the numbers under each square is positive. Prove that a number of copies of the figure can be placed over an m x n rectangle so that each square of the rectangle is covered by the same number of figures.
