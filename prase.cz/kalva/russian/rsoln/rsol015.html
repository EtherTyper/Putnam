<b>Problem 5</b>

<p>

2001 coins, each value 1, 2 or 3 are arranged in a row. Between any two coins of value 1 there is at least one coin, between any two of value 2 there are at least two coins, and between any two of value 3 there are at least three coins. What is the largest number of value 3 coins that could be in the row?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Answer</b>

<p>
501
<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>
The only way we can have two value 3 coins the minimum distance apart is ...31213... . If we repeat that pattern then the conditions are all satisfied. So the optimal configuration is 312131213... . Since 2001 = 1 mod 4 that will give the last coin as 3 and a total of 1 + 2000/4 = 501 value 3 coins.
