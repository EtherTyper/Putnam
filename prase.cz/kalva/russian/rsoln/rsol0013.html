<b>Problem 13</b>

<p>

The sequence a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>, ... is constructed as follows. a<sub>1</sub> = 1. a<sub>n+1</sub> = a<sub>n</sub> - 2 if a<sub>n</sub> - 2 is a positive integer which has not yet appeared in the sequence, and a<sub>n</sub> + 3 otherwise. Show that if a<sub>n</sub> is a square, then a<sub>n</sub> &gt; a<sub>n-1</sub>.
<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

We show by induction that a<sub>5n+1</sub> = 5n+1, a<sub>5n+2</sub> = 5n+4, a<sub>5n+3</sub> = 5n+2, a<sub>5n+4</sub> = 5n+5, a<sub>5n+5</sub> = 5n+3. It is easy to check that a<sub>1</sub> = 1, a<sub>2</sub> = 4, a<sub>3</sub> = 2, a<sub>4</sub> = 5, a<sub>5</sub> = 3, which establishes n = 1.
<p>
So now suppose the result is true for n and smaller. Then in particular a<sub>5n+5</sub> - 2 = 5n+1 is already in the sequence. Hence a<sub>5n+6</sub> = a<sub>5n+5</sub> + 3 = 5(n+1)+1. Similarly a<sub>5n+6</sub> - 2 = 5n+4 is already in the sequence, so a<sub>5n+7</sub> = a<sub>5n+6</sub> + 3 = 5(n+1)+4. But 5(n+1)+2 = a<sub>5n+7</sub> - 2 is not yet in the sequence, so a<sub>5n+8</sub> = 5(n+1)+2. 5(n+1) is already in the sequence, so a<sub>5n+9</sub> = a<sub>5n+8</sub> + 3 = 5(n+1)+5. 5(n+1)+3 is not yet in the sequence, so a<sub>5n+10</sub> = a<sub>5n+9</sub> - 2 = 5(n+1)+3. So we have established the result for n+1 and hence for all n. 
<p>
Now any square must be 0, 1 or 4 mod 5, so it must be a<sub>5n+4</sub>, a<sub>5n+1</sub> or a<sub>5n+2</sub>, which all satisfy the required condition.
