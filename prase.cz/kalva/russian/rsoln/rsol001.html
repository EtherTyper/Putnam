<b>Problem 1</b>

<p>

The equations x<sup>2</sup> + ax + 1 = 0 and x<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 have a common real root, and the equations x<sup>2</sup> + x + a = 0 and x<sup>2</sup> + cx + b = 0 have a common real root. Find a + b + c.

<b>Answer</b>

<p>

-3

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

The common root of x<sup>2</sup> + ax + 1 = 0 and x<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 must also satisfy (a-b)x + (1-c) = 0, so it must be (c-1)/(a-b). Note that the other root of x<sup>2</sup> + ax + 1 = 0 must be (a-b)/(c-1), since the product of the roots is 1. Similarly the common root of x<sup>2</sup> + x + a = 0 and x<sup>2</sup> + cx + b = 0 must satisfy (c-1)x + (b-a) = 0, so it is x = (a-b)/(c-1). Hence x<sup>2</sup> + x + a = 0 and x<sup>2</sup> + ax + 1 = 0 have a common root. Hence it satisfies (a-1)x + (1-a) = 0. Now we cannot have a = 1, for then x<sup>2</sup> + ax + 1 has no real roots. Hence the common root must be 1. Hence both roots of x<sup>2</sup> + ax + 1 = 0 are 1 and so a = -2. 
<p>
So x<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 has one root 1. Then its other root must be c/1 = c. Hence -b = 1 + c, or b + c = -1. Hence a + b + c = -3.
