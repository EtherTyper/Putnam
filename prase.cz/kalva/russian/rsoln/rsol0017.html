<b>Problem 17</b>

<p>

S is a finite set of numbers such that given any three there are two whose sum is in S. What is the largest number of elements that S can have?
<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Answer</b>

<p>

7
<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

Consider S = {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}. Suppose {a, b, c} &sube; S. If a = 0, then a+b &isin; S. If a and b have opposite sign, then |a+b| &lt; max(|a|,|b|), so a+b &isin; S. The only remaining possibilities are {1,2,3} and {-3,-2,-1} and 1+2, -1-2 &isin; S. So there is a set with 7 elements having the required property.
<p>
Now suppose S has 4 positive elements. Take the largest four: a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; d. Consider {b,c,d}. Clearly c+d, b+d &notin; S, so b+c &isin; S and hence b+c = d. But the same argument shows that a+c = d, so a = b. Contradiction. Hence S has at most 3 positive elements. Similarly, it has at most 3 negative elements, and hence at most 7 elements in all.
