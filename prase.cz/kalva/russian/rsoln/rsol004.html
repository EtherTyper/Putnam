<b>Problem 4</b>

<p>

Some pairs of towns are connected by a road. At least 3 roads leave each town. Show that there is a cycle containing a number of towns which is not a multiple of 3.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

Take any town T<sub>1</sub>. Now having found T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, ... , T<sub>i</sub> take T<sub>i+1</sub> distinct from T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, ... , T<sub>i</sub> such that there is a road from T<sub>i</sub> to T<sub>i+1</sub>. Since there are only finitely many towns, this process must terminate at some T<sub>n</sub>. Since T<sub>n</sub> has at least 3 roads and the chain cannot be extended there must be at least two towns T<sub>a</sub> and T<sub>b</sub> with roads to T<sub>n</sub> in the chain (apart from T<sub>n-1</sub>). wlog a &lt; b. Now consider the cycles:
<br>T<sub>a</sub>, T<sub>a+1</sub>, ... , T<sub>n</sub> length n-a+1
<br>T<sub>b</sub>, T<sub>b+1</sub>, ... , T<sub>n</sub> length n-b+1
<br>T<sub>a</sub>, T<sub>a+1</sub>, ... , T<sub>b</sub>, T<sub>n</sub> length b-a+2
<br>
Now (n-a+1) - (n-b+1) - (b-a+2) = -2, which is not divisible by 3, so at least one of the cycles must have length not divisible by 3.
