<b>Problem 7</b>

<p>

N is any point on AC is the longest side of the triangle ABC, such that the perpendicular bisector of AN meets the side AB at K and the perpendicular bisector of NC meets the side BC at M. Prove that BKOM is cyclic, where O is the circumcenter of ABC.

<b>Solution</b>

<p>
Let the midpoints of BC, BA be Q, R respectively. Then OQ is perpendicular to BC and OR is perpendicular to AB, so OQBR is cyclic. Hence &ang;B + &ang;QOR = 180<sup>o</sup>. So it is sufficient to show that &ang;MOQ = &ang;KOR, because then &ang;MOK = &ang;QOR. 
<p>
Let the line through O parallel to BC meet the perpendiculars from K and M to AC at S and T respectively. Then &ang;OQM = &ang;OTM = 90<sup>o</sup>, so MQOT is cyclic, so &ang;MOQ = &ang;MTQ. Similarly, &ang;KOR = &ang;KSR. But QR and ST are both half the length of AC and parallel to it, so QRST is a parallelogram. Hence &ang;MTQ = &ang;KSR. Hence &ang;MOQ = &ang;KOR as required.
