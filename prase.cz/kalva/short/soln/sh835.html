<b>Problem 5</b><br>
<p>
Let S<sub>n</sub> be the set of all strictly decreasing sequences of n positive integers such that no term divides any other term. Given two sequences A = (a<sub>i</sub>) and B = (b<sub>j</sub>) we say that A &lt; B if for some k, a<sub>k</sub>  &lt; b<sub>k</sub> and a<sub>i</sub> = b<sub>i</sub> for i &lt; k. For example, (7, 5, 3) &lt; (9, 7, 2) &lt; (9, 8, 7). Find the sequence A in S<sub>n</sub> such that A &lt; B for any other B in S<sub>n</sub>.

<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
Note that any integer can be written (uniquely) as the product of an odd integer (the <i>odd part</i>) and a power of 2. Two members of a sequence in S<sub>n</sub> must have different odd part, otherwise one would divide the other. So we cannot do better than start the minimal sequence with 2n-1, 2n-3, ... . However, we cannot go further than 2k+1, where k = [(n+1)/3] in this way, or we would get one term 3x another. To check this we need to consider three cases: (1) n=3m, so k = m and 3(2k-1) = 2n-3; (2) n=3m+1, so k=m, and 3(2k-1) = 2n-5; (3) n=3m+2, so k=m+1 and 3(2k-1)=2n-1. So for the final k terms we need to stop them dividing any of the preceding terms. The way to do this whilst keeping them as small as possible is to take 2 x the terms in A<sub>k</sub>. (Note that we clearly need to multiply the odd terms in A<sub>k</sub> by 2, but could we get away without doubling the even terms? They already do not divide the early odd terms in A<sub>n</sub>, but if we fail to double them they will divide one of the newly doubled terms from A<sub>k</sub>.)
<p>
Thus we get:
<br>A<sub>1</sub> = {1}
<br>A<sub>2</sub> = {3,2}
<br>A<sub>3</sub> = {5,3.2}
<br>A<sub>4</sub> = {7,5,3,2}
<br>A<sub>5</sub> = {9,7,6,5,4}
<br>A<sub>6</sub> = {11,9,7,6,5,4}
