<b>Problem 2</b><br>
<p>
1983 cities are served by ten airlines. All services are both ways. There is a direct service between any two cities. Show that at least one of the airlines can offer a round trip with an odd number of landings.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
<i>Solution by Demetres Christofides</i>
<p>
We show by induction that if n airlines serve more than 2<sup>n</sup> cities then at least one offers an odd round trip. For n = 1, this is trivial (there are at least 3 cities, all served by a single airline, so we have a round trip around 3 cities).
<p>
Suppose the result is true for n. For n+1, suppose airline X does not offer an odd round trip. We claim that we can divide the cities into two sets A and B, such that X does not fly between any two cities in A, and X does not fly between any two cities in B. For start by putting any city C into A, then put into B all the cities to which X flies direct from a city in A. Then put into A all the cities to which X flies direct from a city in B. Repeat until we stop adding cities. If this does not exhaust the cities, then put one of the remaining cities into A and repeat, and so on.
<p>
Now at least one of A, B must have &gt; 2<sup>n</sup> cities. Also it must be served entirely by the remaining n airlines. So the result follows by induction.
<p>
Since 1983 &gt; 2<sup>10</sup>, the required result follows.
