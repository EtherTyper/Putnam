<b>Problem 21</b><br>
<p>
49 students solve a set of 3 problems. Each problem is marked from 0 to 7. Show that there are two students A and B such that A scores at least as many as B for each problem.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
We denote a set of scores by (a, b, c), where a is the score on the first problem, b the score on the second problem, and c the score on the third problem. Let X<sub>i</sub> be set of (a, b, c) with a + b + c = i. Obviously we cannot have two distinct triples (a, b, c) and (a', b', c') both in X<sub>i</sub> with a &ge; a', b &ge; b' and c &ge; c'. But it is easy to check that X<sub>10</sub> has 48 elements. So the result is false for 48 students (because each could have a different triple in X<sub>10</sub>).
