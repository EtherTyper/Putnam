<b>Problem 10</b>
<p>
Prove that the product of five consecutive positive integers cannot be the square of an integer. 
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b>
<p>
One of the numbers is not divisible by 2 or 3. If it is divisible by a prime p, then p &ge; 5, so p does not divide any of the other numbers, so the number must be a square. So one of the numbers is b<sup>2</sup> = (6c&plusmn;1)<sup>2</sup> = 12c(3c&plusmn;1)+1 = 1 mod 24, since c(3c&plusmn;1) is even. The only 5 consecutive positive integers which include <i>two</i> squares are 1,2,3,4,5, whose product is not a square (because the difference between any two squares other than 1,4 exceeds 4). So none of the other four numbers (apart from b<sup>2</sup>) is a square and hence none of the others is &plusmn;1 mod 6. So the numbers must be 24k, 24k+1 = b<sup>2</sup>, 24k+2, 24k+3, 24k+4. But now 24k+4 = 4(6k+1), so 6k+1 must be a square and hence 24k+4 is a square. Contradiction.
