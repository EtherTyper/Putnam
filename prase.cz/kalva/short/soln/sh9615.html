<b>Problem 15</b><br>
<p>
One rectangle has sides a, b and another has sides c, d, where a &lt; c &lt;= d &lt; b and ab &lt; cd. Show that the rectangle with smaller area can be placed inside the other rectangle iff (b<sup>2</sup> - a<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup> &le; (bc - ad)<sup>2</sup> + (bd - ac)<sup>2</sup>.

<p>
Place the long side b with one end on the side length c and the other end on the side length d at an angle k as shown in the diagram. A necessary and sufficient condition for the rectangle to fit is that b cos k + a sin k &le; d and a cos k + b sin k &lt;= c. Put x = cos k, y = sin k. Now plot on an x-y diagram as shown on the right. Allowed points are k from 0 to 90<sup>o</sup> and hence (x, y) on the quarter-circle shown from (1, 0) to (0, 1). But the point (x, y) must also lie below both the lines bx + ay = d and ax + by = c. These intersect at the point ( (bd - ac)/(b<sup>2</sup> - a<sup>2</sup>), (bc - ad)/(b<sup>2</sup> - a<sup>2</sup>) ). So a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a solution is that this point lies on or outside the quarter-circle. In other words, we require (bd - ac)<sup>2</sup> + (bc - ad)<sup>2</sup> &ge; (b<sup>2</sup> - a<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>. 
<p>
The left-hand diagram shows the case of fitting a 2 x 10 rectangle inside an 8 x 9 rectangle. It is quite a tight fit, even though the area is much smaller. The condition is 96<sup>2</sup> &le; 62<sup>2</sup> + 74<sup>2</sup>, which is just satisfied.
