<b>Problem G5</b><br>
<p>
ABC is a triangle with inradius r. The circle through A and C orthogonal to the incircle meets the circle through A and B orthogonal to the incircle at A and A'. The points B' and C' are defined similarly. Show that the circumradius of A'B'C' is r/2.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
Let the incircle have center I and touch the sides BC, CA, AB at D, E, F respectively. Let the midpoints of EF, FD, DE be L, M, N respectively. We show that A', B', C' are L, M, N.

<p>
&ang;IDB = 90<sup>o</sup> and, since D is the midpoint of the chord DF of the circle center I, &ang;IMD = 90<sup>o</sup>. So triangles IMD and IDB are similar, so IM/ID = ID/IB or IM&middot;IB = r<sup>2</sup>. Similarly, IN&middot;IC = r<sup>2</sup>. So BMNC is cyclic. Also I lies on the line BM, but not between B and M, so it lies outside the circle BMNC. Suppose the incircle and the circle BMNC meet at K. Then IK<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>2</sup> = IM&middot;IB, so IK must be tangent to the circle. Hence the incircle and the circle BMNC are orthogonal. Similarly, the circles ABML and CNLA are orthogonal to the incircle, so L = A' and similarly M = B' and N = C'.
<p>
But the triangle LMN is similar to the triangle DEF and half the size. The circumradius of DEF is r, so the circumradius of A'B'C' is r/2.
