<b>Problem G3</b><br>
<p>
ABC is a triangle. The incircle touches BC, CA, AB at D, E, F respectively. X is a point inside the triangle such that the incircle of XBC touches BC at D. It touches CX at Y and XB at Z. Show that EFZY is cyclic.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
If EF is parallel to BC, then AB = AC, D is the midpoint of BC, and AD is perpendicular to BC. Hence X lies on AD and YZ is also parallel to BC. So EF is parallel to YZ and AD is an axis of symmetry. Hence EFZY is cyclic.
<p>
So we may assume EF meets BC at P. Hence, by Menelaus' theorem, (AF/FB) (BP/CP) (CE/EA) = 1. But AF = AE (equal tangents to incircle), so (1/FB) (BP/CP) CE = 1. But XY = XZ (equal tangents), and BF = BD (equal tangents) = BZ (equal tangents), and CE = CD (equal tangents) = CY (equal tangents). So (XZ/BZ) (BP/CP) (CY/XY) = 1. Hence applying  Menelaus to the points Z, P, Y on the sides of the triangle XBC, we conclude that Z, P, Y are collinear.
<p>
Hence PE.PF = PD<sup>2</sup> and PY.PZ = PD<sup>2</sup>. So PE.PF = PY.PZ. Hence EFZY is cyclic.
