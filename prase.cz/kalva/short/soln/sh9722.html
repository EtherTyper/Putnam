<b>Problem 22</b>
<p>
Do there exist real-valued functions f and g on the reals such that f( g(x) ) = x<sup>2</sup> and g( f(x) ) = x<sup>3</sup>? Do there exist real-valued functions f and g on the reals such that f( g(x) ) = x<sup>2</sup> and g( f(x) ) = x<sup>4</sup>?
<p>

<b>Answer</b>
<p>
No, yes.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b>
<p>
Suppose such functions exist. Note that f must be injective, for if f(a) = f(b), then a<sup>3</sup> = g(f(a)) = g(f(b)) = b<sup>3</sup>, so a = b. But we also have f(x)<sup>2</sup> = f(g(f(x))) = f(x<sup>3</sup>). Substituting x = 0, &plusmn;1 we see that f(x) = f(x)<sup>2</sup> is satisfied by x = 0, x = 1, x = -1. There are only two solutions to y = y<sup>2</sup>, namely y = 0, 1, so two of f(0), f(1), f(-1) must be equal. Contradiction.
<p>
Put p(x) = 2&radic;x, q(x) = x<sup>2</sup> for x &ge; 0. Then p(q(x)) = 2x, q(p(x)) = 4x. We can extend these to negative x, whilst preserving these relations by putting p(-x) = -p(x), q(-x) = -q(x).
<p>
Now put f(2<sup>t</sup>) = 2<sup>p(t)</sup>, g(2<sup>t</sup>) = 2<sup>q(t)</sup>. It is easy to check that f(g(2<sup>t</sup>) = f(2<sup>q(t)</sup>) = 2<sup>p(q(t))</sup> = 2<sup>2t</sup> = (2<sup>t</sup>)<sup>2</sup> and similarly g(f(2<sup>t</sup>)) = (2<sup>t</sup>)<sup>4</sup>. So f and g satisfy the required relations for positive reals. But we can now extend them by taking f(0) = g(0) = 0 and f(-x) = f(x), g(-x) = g(x).
