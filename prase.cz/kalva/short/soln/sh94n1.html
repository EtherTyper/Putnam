<b>Problem N1</b><br>
<p>
Find the largest possible subset of {1, 2, ... , 15} such that the product of any three distinct elements of the subset is not a square.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
{1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14} shows that we can have a subset of 10 elements with the required property. 
<p>
[This is a matter of tiresome verification. Suppose there is a set T of 3 elements with product a square. If 5 is in T, then 10 must be in T (because it is the only other element divisible by 5). Hence the third element must be 2n<sup>2</sup>, but there is no such element. So 5 is not in T. Hence 10 is not in T. Similarly, if 7 is in T, then 14 must be in T, but then there is no third element of the form 2n<sup>2</sup>, so neither 7 nor 14 can be in T. 11 cannot be in T because it is the only element divisible by 11. Similarly 13. If 6 or 12 is in T, then the other must be (because they are the only elements divisible by 3). But then 6&middot;12 = 3<sup>2</sup>2<sup>3</sup>, so the third element must be divisible by an odd power of 2 and there are none such (except for 10 and 14, which have already been eliminated). So there are at most two candidates for T (1 and 4) which is not enough.]
<p>
If we include 10, 3 and 12 then we must exclude 1 (1&middot;3&middot;12 = 6<sup>2</sup>), 4 (4&middot;3&middot;12 = 12<sup>2</sup>), 9 (9&middot;3&middot;12 = 18<sup>2</sup>), one of 2, 6 (2&middot;6&middot;3 = 6<sup>2</sup>) and one of 5, 15 (3&middot;5&middot;15 = 15<sup>2</sup>), so there are at most 10 elements. If we include 10, and exclude one or more of 3, 12, then we must also exclude at least one of 2, 5 (2&middot;5&middot;10 = 10<sup>2</sup>) and at least one of 1, 4, 9 (1&middot;4&middot;9 = 6<sup>2</sup>) and at least one of 7, 8, 14 (7&middot;8&middot;14 = 28<sup>2</sup>). 
<p>
Finally, suppose we exclude 10. But we must also exclude one of 1, 4, 9 (product 6<sup>2</sup>), one of 2, 6, 12 (product 12<sup>2</sup>), one of 3, 5, 15 (product 15<sup>2</sup>) and one of 7, 8, 14 (product 28<sup>2</sup>). So there are at most 10 elements.
