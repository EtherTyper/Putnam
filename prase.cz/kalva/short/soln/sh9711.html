<b>Problem 11</b>
<p>
p(x) is a polynomial with real coefficients such that p(x) &gt; 0 for x &ge; 0. Show that (1 + x)<sup>n</sup>p(x) has non-negative coefficients for some positive integer n.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b>
<p>
A product of two polynomials with non-negative coefficients also has non-negative coefficients and any real polynomial can be factorised into linear and quadratic factors, so it is sufficient to prove the result for p(x) linear and quadratic.
<p>
If p(x) = ax + b, then b = p(0) &gt; 0. Also p(-b/a) = 0, so -b/a &le; 0 and hence a &ge; 0. So p itself has non-negative coefficients, and hence (1 + x)<sup>n</sup>p(x) has non-negative coefficients for all positive n. Thus the result is true for p(x) linear. 
<p>
Now suppose p(x) is quadratic, p(x) is positive for x zero and x large, so the coefficients of x<sup>2</sup> and x<sup>0</sup> must be positive. There is no loss of generality in taking the coefficient of x<sup>2</sup> to be 1. If the coefficient of x is also positive, then we are home. So assume it is negative. Thus p(x) = x<sup>2</sup> - bx + c, with b, c &gt; 0. Also b<sup>2</sup> &lt; 4c or p(b/2) &lt; 0. So the coefficients of (1+x)<sup>n</sup>p(x) are c, nc - b, n - b, 1 which are all positive for any sufficiently large n, and nCk-2 - nCk-1 b + nCk c for k = 2, 3 ... , n.
<p>
Ignoring the positive factor n!/(k! n-k+2!), we get k<sup>2</sup>(1+b+c) - k(n(b+2c)+2b+3c+1) + c(n<sup>2</sup>+3n+2). Put A = 1+b+c, B = b+2c, C = 2b+3c+1. So we have Ak<sup>2</sup> + (Bn+C)k + c(n<sup>2</sup>+3n+2) (*). Obviously A &gt; 0. But b<sup>2</sup> &lt; 4c, so (b+2c)<sup>2</sup> &lt; 4(1+b+c)c or B<sup>2</sup> &lt; 4Ac. Hence for all sufficiently large n, (Bn+C)<sup>2</sup> &lt; 4Ac(n<sup>2</sup>+3n+2) and so (*) is positive for all k, as required.
