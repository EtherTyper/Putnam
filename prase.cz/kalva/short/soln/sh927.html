<b>Problem 7</b>
<p>
Two circles touch externally at I. The two circles lie inside a large circle and both touch it. The chord BC of the large circle touches both smaller circles (not at I). The common tangent to the two smaller circles at I meets the large circle at A, where A and I are on the same side of the chord BC. Show that I is the incenter of ABC.

<b>Solution</b>

<p>
Let one of the small circles touch the large circle at Q and BC at P. Expand with Q as center so that the small circle goes into the large circle. Then P goes to a point D on the large circle and BC goes into the tangent to the large circle at D, which must be parallel to the tangent to the small circle at P. Hence D must be the midpoint of the arc BC. Now consider triangles BQD, PBD. The angle at D is common and &ang;BQD = &ang;CQD (since arcs BD and CD are equal) = &ang;CBD = &ang;PBD. Hence the triangles are similar. So DB/DP = DQ/DB, so DB<sup>2</sup> = DP&middot;DQ.
<p>
We can now apply the same argument to the other small circle with a similar result. Now invert with center D and radius DB. Then P and Q change places. Also DB is the length of the tangent from D to the circle, so the points of contact of the two tangents from D remain fixed. Hence the circle maps into itself under the inversion. Similarly for the other circle. Hence their point of contact I must remain fixed under the inversion. So DI = DB. But DB is the length of the tangent from D to both circles, so DI must be a tangent to both circles. So A lies on DI. But since D is the midpoint of arc BC, it follows that DA bisects &ang;A.

<p>
Now &ang;BID = &ang;ABI + &ang;BAD. Since DB = DI, &ang;BID = &ang;IBD. Also &ang;BAD = &ang;CAD = &ang;CBD, so &ang;ABI = &ang;BID - &ang;BAD = &ang;IBD - &ang;CBD = &ang;IBC. So IB bisects &ang;ABC. Hence I is the incenter as required.
