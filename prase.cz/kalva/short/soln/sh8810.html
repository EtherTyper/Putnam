<b>Problem 10</b>
<p>
Let X = {1, 2, ... , n}. Find the smallest number of subsets f(n) of X with union X such that given any distinct a, b in X, one of the subsets contains just one of a, b.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Answer</b>
<p>If 2<sup>k-1</sup>  &le; n &lt; 2<sup>k</sup>, then f(n) = k.
<p>
<b>Solution</b>
<p>
Take k so that 2<sup>k-1</sup> &le; n &lt; 2<sup>k</sup>. Then, adding leading zeros as necessary, we can write n as a k digit binary number. Let A<sub>i</sub> be the numbers in X which (when written in binary) have a 1 in place i. That gives us a collection of k subsets. Any number in X must have at least one 1, so the A<sub>i</sub> have union X. Any two distinct numbers in X must differ in at least one place, so if we take that place to be i, then A<sub>i</sub> contains just one of the numbers. Thus f(n) &le; k.
<p>
Now suppose we have a collection of h subsets which satisfies the condition. We can classify the elements according to whether they are in or out of A<sub>i</sub>. That gives 2<sub>h</sub> - 1 possible classifications (-1 because an element must be in at least one A<sub>i</sub>) and no two elements can have the same classification. Hence n &le; 2<sup>h</sup> - 1. So 2<sup>k-1</sup> &lt;= 2<sup>h</sup> - 1 and hence k &le; h, so k &le; f(n).
