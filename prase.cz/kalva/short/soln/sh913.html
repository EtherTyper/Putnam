<b>Problem 3</b>
<p>
If S is a point on the circumcircle of the triangle PQR, show that the feet of the perpendiculars from S to the lines PQ, QR, RP are collinear. Denote the line by [S, PQR]. If ABCDEF is a hexagon whose vertices lie on a circle, show that the lines [A, BDF], [B, ACE], [D, ABF], [E, ABC] are concurrent iff CDEF is a rectangle.

<b>Solution</b>

<p>
The fact that the feet of the perpendiculars are collinear is well-known (the line is known as the Simson line after Robert Simson 1687-1768, although the result seems to have been first proved by William Wallace in 1797). Label the feet of the perpendiculars D, E, F as shown (D on QR etc). 
<p>
The proof is straightforward. &ang;QSR = 180<sup>o</sup> - P (S lies on circumcircle) = angle ESF (SEPF cyclic). Subtracting angle FSR, we get &ang;QSF = &ang;RSE. But SDRE is cyclic, so &ang;RSE = &ang;RDE, and QFDS is cyclic, so &ang;QSF = &ang;QDF. Hence &ang;RDE = &ang;QDF. Hence EDF is a straight line.
<p>
Next we show that [S, PQR] passes through X, the midpoint of HS, where H is the orthocenter of PQR. This is also a well-known result.
<p>
Let the altitude from R meet the circumcircle again at U. Let SU meet PQ at W and let the lines HW and SF meet at V. Then PQ bisects HU (that is a well-known result, easily proved, &ang;QPU = &ang;QRU = 90<sup>o</sup> - Q = &ang;QPH, so U is the reflection of H in PQ). Both HU and SV are perpendicular to PQ, so F is the midpoint of SV. Let SV meet the circle again at R'. Then &ang;SR'R = &ang;SUR (circumcircle) = &ang;WUH (same angle) = &ang;WHU (U reflection of H) = &ang;HVS (HU parallel to SV). So HV is parallel to RR'.
<p>
&ang;SR'R = &ang;SQR (circumcircle) = &ang;SQD (same angle) = &ang;SFD (cyclic). So RR' is parallel to the Simson line (that is also a well-known result). Hence HV is parallel to XF. But F is the midpoint of SV, so X is the midpoint of HS.

Suppose CDEF is a rectangle. Let M be the midpoint of AB. We show that the four lines [A, BDF], [B, ACE], [D, ABF], [E, ABC] all pass through M. Since CE is a diameter, the orthocenter of ACE is A, so [B, ACE] passes through M. Similarly, DF is a diameter, so the orthocenter of BDF is B, and [A, BDF] passes through M.
<p>
Let H be the orthocenter of ABF. Since DF is a diameter, BD is perpendicular to BF. But AH is perpendicular to BF, so BD and AH are parallel. Similarly, AD and BH are both perpendicular to AF and hence parallel. So BDAH is a parallelogram, so M is the midpoint of DH. Hence [D, ABF] passes through M. Similarly, [E, ABC] passes through M.
<p>
The converse seems to be most easily proved using vectors. Going back to the first diagram, take vectors with origin at O. Write the vector OP as <b>p</b> etc. The H is <b>p</b> + <b>q</b> + <b>r</b> (because then PH is <b>q</b> + <b>r</b>, RQ is (<b>q</b> - <b>r</b>), and (<b>q</b> + <b>r</b>)<b>.</b>(<b>q</b> - <b>r</b>) = <b>q</b><sup>2</sup> - <b>r</b><sup>2</sup> = 0). So the point X is &frac12;(<b>p</b> + <b>q</b> + <b>r</b> + <b>s</b>). Thus for the hexagon, we have that [A, BDF] and [D, ABF] intersect at &frac12; (<b>a</b> + <b>b</b> + <b>d</b> + <b>f</b>), and [B, ACE] and [E, ABC] intersect at &frac12;(<b>a</b> + <b>b</b> + <b>c</b> + <b>e</b>). So the lines are concurrent iff <b>d</b> + <b>f</b> = <b>c</b> + <b>e</b> or <b>c</b> - <b>d</b> = <b>f</b> - <b>e</b>. In other words the lines are concurrent iff CDEF is a parallelogram. But any parallelogram inscribed in a circle must be a rectangle.
