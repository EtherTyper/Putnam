<b>Problem G3</b><br>
<p>
ABC is an acute-angled triangle with orthocenter H and circumcenter O. Show that there are points D, E, F on BC, CA, AB respectively such that OD + DH = OE + EH = OF + FH and AD, BE, CF are concurrent.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
Extend the altitude AK to meet the circumcircle again at L. Let the line OL meet the circumcircle again at L' and BC at D. We claim that D (and the corresponding points E and E) meet the requirements.

&ang;BAH = 90<sup>o</sup> - B, &ang;ABH = 90<sup>o</sup> - A, so &ang;BHK = (90<sup>o</sup> - B) + (90<sup>o</sup> - A) = C. But &ang;BLK = C (ACLB cyclic). So BHL is isosceles and K is the midpoint of HL. It follows that DH = DL and hence OD + DH = R, the circumradius. Similarly for E and F, so OD + DH = OE + EH = OF + FH.
<p>
Now ALA'L' is a rectangle with A'L parallel to BC. Hence D and D' are equally spaced about the midpoint of BC. Similarly for E and E', and F and F'. The lines AD', BE', CF' are concurrent (they pass through O). So by Ceva, (BD')/(D'C) (CE'/E'A) (AF'/F'B) = 1. But BD'/D'C = CD/DB etc, hence (BD/DC) (CE/EA) (AF/FB) = 1, so AD, BE, CF are concurrent by Ceva.
