<b>Problem A2</b><br>
<p>
a, b, c are positive integers such that b &gt; 2a, c &gt; 2b. Show that there is a real k such that the fractional parts of ka, kb, kc all exceed 1/3 and do not exceed 2/3.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
Let I<sub>n</sub> denote the interval ( (n + 1/3)/a, (n + 2/3)/a ]. Similarly, let J<sub>n</sub> denote the interval ( (n + 1/3)/b, (n + 2/3)/b ], and K<sub>n</sub> denote the interval ( (n + 1/3)/c, (n + 2/3)/c ]. We wish to show that there is some real value k which belongs to intervals of all three types, for k &isin; I<sub>n</sub> is equivalent to (n + 1/3) &lt; ak &le; (n + 2/3) and hence to the fractional part of ak being &gt; 1/3 and &le; 2/3. Similarly for the other intervals.
<p>
The intervals K<sub>n</sub> are spaced a distance 2/(3c) &lt; 1/(3b) apart. The intervals J<sub>n</sub> all have width 1/(3b), so every J<sub>n</sub> must intersect some K<sub>m</sub>. We claim that we can find a J<sub>n</sub> which is contained in some I<sub>s</sub>. It follows that a common point of J<sub>n</sub> and K<sub>m</sub> also belongs to I<sub>s</sub> and we are done. It remains to prove the claim.
<p>
J<sub>n</sub> &sube; I<sub>s</sub> is equivalent to (s + 1/3)/a &le; (n + 1/3)/b and (n + 2/3)/b &le; (s + 2/3)/a, or (3s+1)/(3n+1) &le; a/b &le; (3s+2)/(3n+2). Now a/b lies in the interval (0, 1/2). We show that for <i>any real</i> number h in (0, 1/2) we can find s, n such that (3s+1)/(3n+1) &le; h &le; (3s+2)/(3n+2). 
<p>
For if h &le; 1/4, then we can take the smallest positive integer N such that 1/(3.2<sup>N</sup> + 1) &lt; h. Then 2/(3.2<sup>N</sup> + 2) = 1/(3.2<sup>N-1</sup> + 1) &ge; h. [Note that if N = 1, this is still true since 1/3 &gt; 1/4 &ge; h.]. Hence h belongs to the interval [1/(3.2<sup>N</sup> + 1), 2/(3.2<sup>N</sup> + 2) ) and we can put s = 0, n = 2<sup>N</sup>.
<p>
For N = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... we have (3.2<sup>N</sup>  - 2)/(3.2<sup>N+1</sup>- 2) = 1/4, 2/5, 5/11, ... . The sequence obviously tends to 1/2. So for any h satsifying 1/4 &lt; h &lt; 1/2 take the smallest non-negative integer N such that (3.2<sup>N</sup> - 2)/(3.2<sup>N+1</sup> - 2) &le; h. So h &lt; (3.2<sup>N+1</sup> - 2)/(3.2<sup>N+2</sup> - 2) = (3.2<sup>N</sup> - 1)/(3.2<sup>N+1</sup> - 1) = (3s+2)/(3n+2), with s = (2<sup>N</sup> - 1), n = (2<sup>N+1</sup> - 1). Also (3.2<sup>N</sup> - 2)/(3.2<sup>N+1</sup> - 2) = (3s+1)/(3n+1), so (3s+1)/(3n+1) &le; h &lt; (3s+2)/(3n+2), as required.
<p>
<i>Note that we do not require a, b, c to be integral.</i>
