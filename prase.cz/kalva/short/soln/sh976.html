<b>Problem 6</b><br>
<p>
Let a, b, c be positive integers such that a and b are relatively prime and c is relatively prime to a or b. Show that there are infinitely many solutions to m<sup>a</sup> + n<sup>b</sup> = k<sup>c</sup>, where m, n, k are distinct positive integers.

<b>Solution</b><br>
<p><i>Many thanks to Kamil Duszenko for the following solution</i>
<p>
If a or b = 1, then the problem is trivial (if a = 1, then just put m = k<sup>c</sup> - n<sup>b</sup>. We can obviously get m, n, k distinct and positive for infinitely many choices of k and n). So assume a, b &gt; 1. 
<p>
Now take m = 2<sup>tb</sup>, n = 2<sup>ta</sup>, k = (tab + 1)/c. Since c is relatively prime to ab, we can find t such that tab = -1 mod c. Then all t + c, t + 2c, t + 3c, ... have the same property. So there are infinitely many t for which m, n, k are positive integers. Obviously, m<sup>a</sup> + n<sup>b</sup> = k<sup>c</sup>, and m and n are distinct. Suppose m = k. Then tb = tab + 1, so b = 1. Contradiction. Similarly, n cannot be k. So m, n, k are all distinct.
