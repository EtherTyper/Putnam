<b>Problem 1</b>
<p>
Is there a positive integer which can be written as the sum of 1990 consecutive positive integers and which can be written as a sum of two or more consecutive positive integers in just 1990 ways?
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Answer</b>
<p>
Yes
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b>
<p>
We require N = m + (m+1) + ... + (m+1989) = 1990m + 1989&middot;1990/2 = 5&middot;199(2m+1989). So N must be odd and divisible by 5 and 199.
<p>
We also require that there are just 1990 pairs m, n such that N = m + (m+1) + ... + (m+n) = (n+1)(n+2m)/2, or equivalently, such that 2N = (n+1)(n+2m). Note that n+1 &lt; n+2m. So if a is any factor of 2N, put b = 2N/a. Let A be the smaller of a, b and B the larger. Then, provided that A &gt; 1, we can take n+1 to be A and m to be (B+1-A)/2. Since N is odd, just one of A, B will be even, so (B+1-A) is even and m is integral. Thus we require 2N to have 2&middot;1991 factors (the extra two are the pair 1 and N which do not give a solution) = 2&middot;11&middot;181. We know that 2N has factors 2, 5, 199, so it cannot have any others. The factor 2<sup>1</sup> gives rise to the factor (1+1) = 2, the other two must give rise to the 11 and the 181. So N = 5<sup>10</sup>199<sup>180</sup> or 5<sup>180</sup>199<sup>10</sup>.
