<b>Problem 1</b>
<p>
Show that there is a finite set of points in the plane such that for any point P in the set we can find 1993 points in the set a distance 1 from P.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b>
<p>
The basic idea is that we can find a circle which passes through a large number of lattice points. The point (&plusmn;(t<sup>2</sup>-1)/t<sup>2</sup>+1), &plusmn;2t/(t<sup>2</sup>+1)) lies on the unit circle, so the set of such points for t = 1,2,...,1993 has 1993 points on each quadrant of the unit circle. Put n = &prod;<sub>1</sub><sup>1993</sup>(1+t<sup>2</sup>), then all these points can be written as m/n, where m is an integer with |m| &le; n.
<p>
Now consider the array of points (a/n, b/n), where 0 &le; a,b &le; 2n. The unit circle centered at any of these points has at least one of its quadrants passing through the array and hence contains at least 1993 of the points.
