<b>Problem 12</b><br>
<p>
Given 1985 points inside a unit cube, show that we can always choose 32 such that any polygon with these points as vertices has perimeter less than 8&radic;3.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
64 x 31 = 1984. So if we divide the cube into 64 cubes side 1/4, then one of the small cubes must contain 32 points. Each pair of points in the cube is at most a distance (&radic;3)/4 apart, so the 32-gon has perimeter <i>less</i> than 8&radic;3 (if all pairs had distance (&radic;3)/4 then some of the points would be coincident).
