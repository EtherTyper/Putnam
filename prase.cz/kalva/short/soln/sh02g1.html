<b>Problem G1</b><br>
<p>
B is a point on the circle S. A is a point (distinct from B) on the tangent to S at B. C is a point not on S such that the line segment AC meets the circle S at two distinct points. S' is a circle which touches AC at C and S at D, where B and D are on opposite sides of the line AC. Show that the circumcenter of BCD lies on the circumcircle of ABC.

<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
Let T<sub>1</sub> be the tangent AB, T<sub>2</sub> the tangent to the two circles at D, and T<sub>3</sub> the tangent AC. Points on the perpendicular bisector of BD are equidistant from T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>, and points on the perpendicular bisector of CD are equidistant from T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>. So the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors is equidistant from T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> and hence lies on the angle bisector of BAC. But it also lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC and hence on the circumcircle of BAC (because if O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisector and the arc, then the arcs BO and BC are equal, so subtend equal angles at A, so O lies on the angle bisector).
