<b>Problem 9</b><br>
<p>
Define the sequence a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>, ... by 2<sup>n</sup> = the sum of a<sub>d</sub> such that d divides n. Show that a<sub>n</sub> is divisible by n. [For example, a<sub>1</sub> = 2, a<sub>2</sub> = 2, a<sub>3</sub> = 6.]
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
Let b<sub>n</sub> be the number of sequences of length n, made up of 0s and 1s, which cannot be divided into more than one identical block. Then b<sub>n</sub> satisfies the same recurrence relation as a<sub>n</sub> and has the same initial values. So they are the same. But b<sub>n</sub> must be divisible by n, because we can divide the non-repeating sequences of length n into groups of n, where the sequences in each group are obtained from each other by cyclic shifts.
