<b>Problem 25</b><br>
<p>
34 countries each sent a leader and a deputy leader to a meeting. Some of the participants shook hands before the meeting, but no leader shook hands with his deputy. Let S be the set of all 68 participants except the leader of country X. Every member of S shook hands with a different number of people (possibly zero). How many people shook hands with the leader or deputy leader of X?

<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
<i>Solution by Demetres Christofides</i>
<p>
Answer: 33.
<p>
There are 68 delegates. Each shakes hands with at most 66 others, so we can label the 67 members of &nbsp; S as a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ... , a<sub>66</sub>, where a<sub>n</sub> shakes hands with n delegates. Let L be the leader of country X. We claim that: (1) a<sub>66</sub> shakes hands with a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ... , a<sub>65</sub> and L, and is from the same country as a<sub>0</sub>; (2) for n = 1, 2, ... , 32, delegate a<sub>n</sub> shakes hands with a<sub>67-n</sub>, a<sub>68-n</sub>, ... , a<sub>66</sub> and is the partner of a<sub>66-n</sub> who shakes hands with , a<sub>n+1</sub>, a<sub>n+2</sub>, ... , a<sub>66</sub> (except himself) and L, (3) the deputy leader is a<sub>33</sub>, (4) L shakes hands with a<sub>34</sub>, a<sub>35</sub>, ... , a<sub>66</sub>.
<p>
Note that a<sub>66</sub> shakes hands with everyone except himself and the other delegate from his country. a<sub>0</sub> does not shake hands with anyone, and hence in particular does not shake hands with a<sub>66</sub>, so they must be from the same country. That establishes (1).
<p>
We prove (2) by induction. (1) is effectively the case n = 0. Suppose it is true for all m &lt; n &lt; 32. Then a<sub>66-m</sub> shakes hands with a<sub>n</sub> (by induction) for m = 0, 1, ... , n-1. That accounts for all n people who shake hands with a<sub>n</sub>. Similarly, a<sub>m</sub> does not shake hands with a<sub>66-n</sub>, which gives n people who do not shake hands with a<sub>66-n</sub>. We have just established that a<sub>n</sub> does not and a<sub>66-n</sub> himself does not, so we have n+2 people who do not, and hence at most 68-(n+2) = 66-n who do. So the n+2 people are the <i>only</i> people who do not. The only candidate for the partner of a<sub>66-n</sub> is a<sub>n</sub>. That establishes the case n. So by induction it is true for n = 1, 2, ... , 32. 
<p>
The only person unaccounted for, who could be L's partner is a<sub>33</sub>. That establishes (3). We establish (4) by inspection of (1) and (2). Finally, we note that a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ... , a<sub>32</sub> do not shake hands with L or a<sub>33</sub>, whereas a<sub>34</sub>, a<sub>35</sub>, ... , a<sub>66</sub> shake hands with both a<sub>33</sub> and L.
