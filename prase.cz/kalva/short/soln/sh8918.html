<b>Problem 18</b><br>
<p>
Five points are placed on a sphere of radius 1. That is the largest possible value for the shortest distance between two of the points? Find all configurations for which the maximum is attained.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
Answer: &radic;2. All maximal configurations have two points at opposite ends of a diameter. The other three points lie on the great circle midway between these two points (such that the distance between any two is at least &radic;2).
<p>
Suppose the points are such that the distance between any two is at least &radic;2. Then any two must subtend an angle of at least 90<sup>o</sup> at the center of the sphere. We claim that two of the points must be at opposite ends of a diameter. Let S be one of the points. Take it at the south pole. So suppose that none of the points is at the north pole N. If the other 4 points all lie on the equator, then they must be equally spaced and so a pair lie at opposite ends of a diameter as claimed.

If there is a point X not on the equator, then take a line of longitude L<sub>1</sub> through it. Now take three other lines of longitude L<sub>2</sub>, L<sub>3</sub>, L<sub>4</sub>, so that the 4 lines are equally spaced. They divide the northern hemisphere into 4 equal quadrants (which overlap along the lines of longitude). Each quadrant is a curvilinear triangle with three vertices. Clearly, if no two points in the same quadrant subtend an angle of more than 90<sup>o</sup> at the center, and if they subtend an angle of 90<sup>o</sup>, then one must be a vertex and the other must be on the opposite (curvilinear) side. Thus (1) the minimum angle is at least 90<sup>o</sup>, and (2) each of the two quadrants containing X must contain another of the 4 points (apart from X) and they must lie at P and P'. But now P and P' are opposite ends of a diameter. 
<p>
Now if 2 of the 5 points are opposite ends of a diameter, and the minimum distance is at least &radic;2, then the other three points must lie on the great circle midway between.
