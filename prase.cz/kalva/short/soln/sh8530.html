<b>Problem 30</b><br>
<p>
C is a circle and L a line not meeting it. M and N are variable points on L such that the circle diameter MN touches C but does not contain it. Show that there is a fixed point P such that the &ang;MPN is constant.
<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
<i>Solution by Demetres Christofides</i>
<p>
Answer: let O be the center of C, let C have radius 1, let D be the foot of the perpendicular from O to L and let OD = a. Then P is the point on the segment OD a distance &radic;(a<sup>2</sup> - 1) from D.
<p>
Let MN = 2x. Let Q be the midpoint of MN. The circles touch, so OQ = x + 1. Suppose first that D is between M and N and that N is closer to D. We have QD<sup>2</sup> = (x+1)<sup>2</sup> - a<sup>2</sup>, QP<sup>2</sup> = QD<sup>2</sup> + DP<sup>2</sup> = (x+1)<sup>2</sup> - a<sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup> - 1. Now tan MPD = (x + QD)/PD, tan NPD = (x - QD)/PD, so tan MPN = tan(MPD + NPD) = 2x PD/(PD<sup>2</sup> + QD<sup>2</sup> - x<sup>2</sup>) = &radic;(a<sup>2</sup> - 1), which is independent of x.
<p>
Similarly, if D is not between M and N, but is closer to M, then we have tan MPD = (QD - x)/PD, tan NPD = (QD + x)/PD, tan MPD = tan(NPD - MPD) and we get the same result.
