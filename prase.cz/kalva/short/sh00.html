<b>C5.</b>&nbsp; n rectangles are drawn in the plane. Each rectangle has parallel sides and the sides of distinct rectangles lie on distinct lines. The rectangles divide the plane into a number of regions. For each region R let v(R) be the number of vertices. Take the sum &sum; v(R) over the regions which have one or more vertices of the rectangles in their boundary. Show that this sum is less than 40n.

For example, for the two rectangles illustrated the sum is 28 &lt; 80. Note that the unbounded outer region has 12 vertices, and we do not count the central region because it does not contain any vertices of the two rectangles.
