<b>C1.</b>&nbsp; Two players play alternately on a 5 x 5 board. The first player always enters a 1 into an empty square and the second player always enters a 0 into an empty square. When the board is full, the sum of the numbers in each of the nine 3 x 3 squares is calculated and the first player's score is the largest such sum. What is the largest score the first player can make (if the second player plays so as to minimise this score)?

<b>C2.</b>&nbsp; A finite graph is connected. A positive real number is assigned to each point. Each point is colored red or blue and at least one point is colored red. Show that, given a knowledge of (1) the points and edges of the graph, (2) the number assigned to each red point, and (3) for each blue point the average of the numbers for the points joined to it, one can find the number assigned to each point.

<b>C3.</b>&nbsp; Peter has three accounts at a bank, each with an integral number of dollars.

Show that by a series of transfers he can always empty one account, but that he cannot always get all his money into one account.

<b>C4.</b>&nbsp; There are n+1 cells in a row labeled from 0 to n and n+1 cards labeled from 0 to n. The cards are arbitrarily placed in the cells, one per cell. The objective is to get card i into cell i for each i. The allowed move is to find  the smallest h such that cell h has a card with a label k &gt; h, pick up that card, slide the cards in cells h+1, h+2, ... , k one cell to the left and to place card k in cell k. Show that at most 2<sup>n</sup> - 1 moves are required to get every card into the correct cell and that there is a unique starting position which requires 2<sup>n</sup> - 1 moves. [For example, if n = 2 and the initial position is 210, then we get 102, then 012, a total of 2 moves.]

<b>C5.</b>&nbsp; 1994 girls are seated at a round table. Initially one girl holds n tokens. Each turn a girl who is holding more than one token passes one token to each of her neighbours. Show that if n &lt; 1994, the game must terminate. Show that if n = 1994 it cannot terminate. [Note: Sweden proposed the problem with 1991 girls (in which case you must show the game terminates for n &le; 1991), but the PIG (see below) decided that was too difficult.]
