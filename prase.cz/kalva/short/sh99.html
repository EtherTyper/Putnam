<b>A2.</b>&nbsp; The numbers 1 to n<sup>2</sup> are arranged in the squares of an n x n board (1 per square). There are n<sup>2</sup> (n-1) pairs of numbers in the same row or column. For each such pair take the larger number divided by the smaller. Then take the smallest such ratio and call it the <i>minrat</i> of the arrangement. So, for example, if n<sup>2</sup> and n<sup>2</sup> - 1 were in the same row, then the minrat would be n<sup>2</sup>/(n<sup>2</sup> - 1). What is the largest possible minrat?

<b>A3.</b>&nbsp; Each of n &gt; 1 girls has a doll with her name on it. Each pair of girls swaps dolls in some order. For which values of n is it possible for each girl to end up (1) with her own doll, (2) with another girl's doll? [For example, if n = 4, denote girls by A, B, C, D and dolls by a, b, c, d. So the initial position is Aa Bb Cc Dd. If the swaps are in the order AB, CD, AC, BD, AD, BC, then the successive positions are Ab Ba Cc Dd, Ab Ba Cd Dc, Ad Ba Cb Dc, Ad Bc Cb Da, Aa Bc Cb Dd and Aa Bb Cc Dd. So for n = 4, (1) is possible.]

<b>A6.</b>&nbsp; Given real numbers x<sub>1</sub> &le; x<sub>2</sub> &lt;= ... &lt;= x<sub>n</sub> (with n &gt; 2), carry out the following procedure:
<br>(1) arrange the numbers in a circle; 
<br>(2) delete one of the numbers; 
<br>(3) if just two numbers are left, then take their sum. Otherwise replace each number by the sum of it and the number on its right. Go to step 2.
<br>Show that the largest sum that can be achieved by this procedure is (n-2)C0 x<sub>2</sub> + (n-2)C0 x<sub>3</sub> + (n-2)C1 x<sub>4</sub> + (n-2)C1 x<sub>5</sub> + (n-2)C2 x<sub>6</sub> + ... + (n-2)C( [n/2]-1 ) x<sub>n</sub>, where mCk represents the binomial coefficient.

<b>C1.</b>&nbsp; A <i>low path</i> from the lattice point (0, 0) to the lattice point (n, n) is a sequence of 2n moves, each one point up or one point to the right, starting at (0, 0) and ending at (n, n) such that all points of the path satisfy y &lt;= x.
