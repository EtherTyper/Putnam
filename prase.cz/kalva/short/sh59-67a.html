<p>
Taken from the Russian book "International Mathematical Olympiads", publ Moscow 1968. This book apparently came out annually. Does anyone know how complete its list of shortlist questions is? Presumably question 10 was on the 1964 shortlist and the questions are arranged according to the year. So this source gives at most 9 questions for the 5 years 1959-1963, and at least 52 (and at most 61) for the 4 years 1964-7 (an average of 13 - 15 a year). Note that in the early years few countries competed in the IMO: 1959 <b>7</b> (all Soviet bloc), 1960 <b>5</b>, 1961 <b>6</b>, 1962 <b>7</b>, 1963 <b>8</b>, 1964 <b>9</b>, 1965 <b>10</b>, 1966 <b>9</b>, 1967 <b>13</b> (first Western countries competed). So presumably there were fewer questions submitted.
