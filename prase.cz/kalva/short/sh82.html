<b>1.</b>&nbsp; An urn contains w white balls and b black balls. In each move, two balls are drawn at random and removed from the urn, and one ball is added. If the two balls drawn have the same color, then a black ball is added. If they are opposite colors, then a white ball is added. Eventually, only one ball is left. What is the probability that it is white?
