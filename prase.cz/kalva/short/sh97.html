<b>2.</b>&nbsp; The sequences R<sub>n</sub> are defined as follows. R<sub>1</sub> = (1). If R<sub>n</sub> = (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ... , a<sub>m</sub>), then R<sub>n+1</sub> = (1, 2, ... , a<sub>1</sub>, 1, 2, ... , a<sub>2</sub>, 1, 2, ... , 1, 2, ... , a<sub>m</sub>, n+1). For example, R<sub>2</sub> = (1, 2), R<sub>3</sub> = (1, 1, 2, 3), R<sub>4</sub> = (1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4). Show that for n &gt; 1, the kth term from the left in R<sub>n</sub> is 1 iff the kth term from the right is not 1.
