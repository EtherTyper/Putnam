<b>B1.</b>&nbsp; ABC is a triangle. AH is the altitude. P, Q are the feet of the perpendiculars from P to AB, AC respectively. M is a variable point on PQ. The line through M perpendicular to MH meets the lines AB, AC at R, S respectively. Show that ARHS is cyclic. If M' is another position of M with corresponding points R', S', show that the ratio RR'/SS' is constant. Find the conditions on ABC such that if M moves at constant speed along PQ, then the speeds of R along AB and S along AC are the same. The point K on the line HM is on the other side of M to H and satisfies KM = HM. The line through K perpendicular to PQ meets the line RS at D. Show that if &ang;A = 90<sup>o</sup>, then &ang;BHR = &ang;DHR.
