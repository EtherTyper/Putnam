<b>Problem B2</b>

<p>

The polynomial p(x) with degree at least 1 satisfies p(x) p(2x<sup>2</sup>) = p(3x<sup>3</sup> + x). Show that it does not have any real roots.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

Suppose it has a positive root &alpha;, then 3&alpha;3+&alpha; is another root, which is larger than &alpha;. Proceeding, we get infinitely many roots. Contradiction. So there are no positive roots. Similarly, there are no negative roots. So the only possibility is 0. Suppose bx<sup>m</sup> is the lowest power of x in p(x). Then the lowest power of x in p(x)p(2x<sup>2</sup>) is x<sup>3m</sup>, but the lowest power of x in p(3x<sup>3</sup> + x) is x<sup>m</sup>, so m = 0 and hence p(0) = b &ne; 0, so 0 is not a root.
