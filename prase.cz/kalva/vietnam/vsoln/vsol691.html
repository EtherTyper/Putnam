<b>Problem A3</b>

<p>

A graph G has n + k points. A is a subset of n points and B is the subset of the other k points. Each point of A is joined to at least k - m points of B where nm &lt; k. Show that there is a point in B which is joined every point in A.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>
This is just the pigeonhole principle. There are at least n(k-m) &gt; (n-1)k edges from points of A to points of B and there are k points in B. So some point of B must have at least n edges (otherwise there would be &le; (n-1)k edges). That point is joined to every point of A.
