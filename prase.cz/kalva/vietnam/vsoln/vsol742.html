<b>Problem A2</b>

<p>

(1) How many positive integers n are such that n is divisible by 8 and n+1 is divisible by 25?

<br>(2) How many positive integers n are such that n is divisible by 21 and n+1 is divisible by 165?

<br>(3) Find all integers n such that n is divisible by 9, n+1 is divisible by 25 and n+2 is divisible by 4.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Answer</b>

<p>

infinitely many, none, n = 774 mod 900
<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>
(1) We need n = 0 mod 8 and -1 mod 25. Hence n = 24 mod 200.
<p>
(2) We need n = 0 mod 21, n = -1 mod 165. But 3 divides 165, so we require n = 0 mod 3 and 2 mod 3, which is impossible.
<p>
(3) We need n = 0 mod 9, -1 mod 25, 2 mod 4. Hence n = 99 mod 225, and 2 mod 4, so n = 774 mod 900
