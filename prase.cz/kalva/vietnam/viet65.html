<b>1.</b>&nbsp;  At time t = 0, a lion L is standing at point O and a horse H is at point A running with speed v perpendicular to OA. The speed and direction of the horse does not change. The lion's strategy is to run with constant speed u at an angle 0 &lt; &phi; &lt; &pi;/2 to the line LH. What is the condition on u and v for this strategy to result in the lion catching the horse? If the lion does not catch the horse, how close does he get? What is the choice of &phi; required to minimise this distance?

<b>2.</b>&nbsp; AB and CD are two fixed parallel chords of the circle S. M is a variable point on the circle. Q is the intersection of the lines MD and AB. X is the circumcenter of the triangle MCQ. Find the locus of X. What happens to X as M tends to (1) D, (2) C? Find a point E outside the plane of S such that the circumcenter of the tetrahedron MCQE has the same locus as X.
