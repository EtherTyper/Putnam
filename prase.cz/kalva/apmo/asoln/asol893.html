<b>Problem 3</b><br>
<p>
ABC is a triangle. X lies on the segment AB so that AX/AB = 1/4. CX intersects the median from A at A' and the median from B at B''. Points B', C', A'', C'' are defined similarly. Find the area of the triangle A''B''C'' divided by the area of the triangle A'B'C'.

<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
Answer: 25/49.
<p>
Let M be the midpoint of AB. We use vectors center G. Take GA = <b>A</b>, GB = <b>B</b>, GC = <b>C</b>. Then GM = <b>A</b>/2 + <b>B</b>/2 and GX = 3/4 <b>A</b> + 1/4 <b>C</b>. Hence GA' = 2/5 <b>A</b> (showing it lies on GA) = 4/5 (3/4 <b>A</b> + 1/4 <b>B</b>) + 1/5 <b>C</b>, since <b>A</b> + <b>B</b> + <b>C</b> = 0 (which shows it lies on CX). Similarly, GB'' = 4/7 (1/2 <b>A</b> + 1/2 <b>C</b>) (showing it lies on the median through B) = 2/7 <b>A</b> + 2/7 <b>C</b> = 5/7 (2/5 <b>A</b>) + 2/7 <b>C</b> (showing it lies on CA' and hence on CX). Hence GB'' = -2/7 <b>B</b>. So we have shown that GB'' is parallel to GB' and 5/7 the length. The same applies to the distances from the centroid to the other vertices. Hence triangle A''B''C'' is similar to triangle A'B'C' and its area is 25/49 times the area of A'B'C'.
