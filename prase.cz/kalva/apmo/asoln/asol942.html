<b>Problem 2</b><br>
<p>
ABC is a triangle and A, B, C are not collinear. Prove that the distance between the orthocenter and the circumcenter is less than three times the circumradius.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
We use vectors. It is well-known that the circumcenter O, the centroid G and the orthocenter H lie on the Euler line and that OH = 3 OG. Hence taking vectors with origin O, <b>OH</b> = 3 <b>OG</b> = <b>OA</b> + <b>OB</b> + <b>OC</b>. Hence |OH| &le; |OA| + |OB| + |OC| = 3 x circumradius. We could have equality only if ABC were collinear, but that is impossible, because ABC would not then be a triangle.
