<b>Problem 3</b><br>
<p>
ABCD is a fixed cyclic quadrilateral with AB not parallel to CD. Find the locus of points P for which we can find circles through AB and CD touching at P.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
Answer: Let the lines AB and CD meet at X. Let R be the length of a tangent from X to the circle ABCD. The locus is the circle center X radius R. [Strictly you must exclude four points unless you allow the degenerate straight line circles.]
<p>
Let X be the intersection of the lines AB and CD. Let R be the length of a tangent from X to the circle ABCD. Let C<sub>0</sub> be the circle center X radius R. Take any point P on C<sub>0</sub>. Then considering the original circle ABCD, we have that R<sup>2</sup> = XA&middot;XB = XC&middot;XD, and hence XP<sup>2</sup> = XA&middot;XB = XC&middot;XD.
<p>

If C<sub>1</sub> is the circle through C, D and P, then XC.XD = XP<sup>2</sup>, so XP is tangent to the circle C<sub>1</sub>. Similarly, the circle C<sub>2</sub> through A, B and P is tangent to XP. Hence C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> are tangent to each other at P. Note that if P is one of the 4 points on AB or CD and C<sub>0</sub>, then this construction does not work unless we allow the degenerate straight line circles AB and CD.
<p>
So we have established that all (or all but 4) points of C<sub>0</sub> lie on the locus. But for any given circle through C, D, there are only two circles through A, B which touch it (this is clear if you consider how the circle through A, B changes as its center moves along the perpendicular bisector of AB), so there are at most 2 points on the locus lying on a given circle through C, D. But these are just the two points of intersection of the circle with C<sub>0</sub>. So there are no points on the locus not on C<sub>0</sub>.
