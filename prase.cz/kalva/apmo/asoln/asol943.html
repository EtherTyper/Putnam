<b>Problem 3</b><br>
<p>
Find all positive integers n such that n = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>, where a and b are relatively prime positive integers, and every prime not exceeding &radic;n divides ab.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b><br>
<p>
Answer: 2 = 1<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup>, 5 = 1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>, 13 = 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>.
<p>
The key is to use the fact that a and b are relatively prime. We show in fact that they must differ by 1 (or 0). Suppose first that a = b. Then since they are relatively prime they must both be 1. That gives the first answer above. So we may take a &gt; b. Then (a - b)<sup>2</sup> &lt; a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = n, so if a - b is not 1, it must have a prime factor which divides ab. But then it must divide a or b and hence both. Contradiction. So a = b + 1. 
<p>
Now (b - 1)<sup>2</sup> &lt; b<sup>2</sup> &lt; n, so any prime factor p of b - 1 must divide ab = b(b + 1). It cannot divide b (or it would divide b and b - 1 and hence 1), so it must divide b + 1 and hence must be 2. But if 4 divides b - 1, then 4 does not divide b(b - 1), so b - 1 must be 0, 1 or 2. But it is now easy to check the cases a, b = (4, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1).
