<b>Problem 3</b>
<p>
k &gt; 14 is an integer and p is the largest prime smaller than k. k is chosen so that p &ge; 3k/4. Prove that 2p does not divide (2p - k)!, but that n does divide (n - k)! for composite n &gt; 2p.
<p>
&nbsp;<p>
<b>Solution</b>
<p>
Since k &gt; p, we have p &gt; 2p-k and hence p does not divide any of 1, 2, 3, ... , 2p-k. But p is prime, so it does not divide (2p - k)! So 2p does not either.
<p>
Now consider composite n &gt; 2p. Note that k &gt; 14, so p &ge; 13, so n &gt; 26. Take q to be the largest prime divisor of n and put n = qr. We now have three cases.
<p>
(1) q &gt; r &ge; 3. Then n &gt; 2p &ge; 3k/2, so 2n/3 &gt; k. Hence n-k &gt; n-2n/3 = n/3 &ge; n/r = q &gt; r. So q and r are distinct integers &lt; n-k. Hence n = qr divides (n-k)!.
<p>
(2) r = 2. Then n = 2q &gt; 2p. But p is the largest prime &lt; k. Hence q &ge; k, so n-k &ge; n-q = q. Obviously q &gt; 2 (since n &gt; 26), so q and 2 are distinct integers &lt; n-k. Hence n = 2q divides (n-k)! .
<p>
(3) The final case is n = q<sup>2</sup>. We show that 2q &le; n-k. Suppose not. Then 2q &ge; n-k+1 &ge; (2p+1)-k+1 &ge; 3k/2 + 1 - k + 1 = k/2 + 2. So q &ge; k/4 + 1. Also since 2q &ge; n-k+1, we have k &ge; n-2q+1 = (q-1)<sup>2</sup> &ge; k<sup>2</sup>/16. If k &gt; 16, this is a contradiction. If k = 15 or 16, then p = 13 and k &ge; (q-1)<sup>2</sup> gives q &le; 5, so n = q<sup>2</sup> &le; 25. But n &gt; 2p = 26. Contradiction. So we have established that 2q &le; n-k. But that means that q and 2q are distinct integers &le; n-k and so their product 2n divides (n-k)!.
