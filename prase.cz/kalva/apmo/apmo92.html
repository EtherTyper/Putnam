<b>A1.</b>&nbsp; A triangle has sides a, b, c. Construct another triangle sides (-a + b + c)/2, (a - b + c)/2, (a + b - c)/2. For which triangles can this process be repeated arbitrarily many times?

<b>A3.</b>&nbsp; Given three positive integers a, b, c, we can derive 8 numbers using one addition and one multiplication and using each number just once: a+b+c, a+bc, b+ac, c+ab, (a+b)c, (b+c)a, (c+a)b, abc. Show that if a, b, c are distinct positive integers such that n/2 &lt; a, b, c, &le; n, then the 8 derived numbers are all different. Show that if p is prime and n &ge; p<sup>2</sup>, then there are just d(p-1) ways of choosing two distinct numbers b, c from {p+1, p+2, ... , n} so that the 8 numbers derived from p, b, c are <i>not</i> all distinct, where d(p-1) is the number of positive divisors of p-1.

<b>A4.</b>&nbsp; Find all possible pairs of positive integers (m, n) so that if you draw n lines which intersect in n(n-1)/2 distinct points and m parallel lines which meet the n lines in a further mn points (distinct from each other and from the first n(n-1)/2) points, then you form exactly 1992 regions.
