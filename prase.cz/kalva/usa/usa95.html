<b>1.</b>&nbsp; The sequence a<sub>0</sub>a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ... of non-negative integers is defined as follows. The first p-1 terms are 0, 1, 2, 3, ... , p-2. Then a<sub>n</sub> is the least positive integer so that there is no arithmetic progression of length p in the first n+1 terms. If p is an odd prime, show that a<sub>n</sub> is the number obtained by writing n in base p-1, then treating the result as a number in base p. For example, if p is 5, to get the 5th term one writes 5 as 11 in base 4, then treats this as a base 5 number to get 6.

<b>2.</b>&nbsp; A trigonometric map is any one of sin, cos, tan, arcsin, arccos and arctan. Show that given any positive rational number x, one can find a finite sequence of trigonometric maps which take 0 to x. [So we need to show that we can always find a sequence of trigonometric maps t<sub>i</sub> so that: x<sub>1</sub> = t<sub>0</sub>(0), x<sub>2</sub> = t<sub>1</sub>(x<sub>1</sub>), ... , x<sub>n</sub> = t<sub>n-1</sub>(x<sub>n-1</sub>), x = t<sub>n</sub>(x<sub>n</sub>).]

<b>3.</b>&nbsp; The circumcenter O of the triangle ABC does not lie on any side or median. Let the midpoints of BC, CA, AB be L, M, N respectively. Take P, Q, R on the rays OL, OM, ON respectively so that &ang;OPA = &ang;OAL, &ang;OQB = &ang;OBM and &ang;ORC = &ang;OCN. Show that AP, BQ and CR meet at a point.

<b>4.</b>&nbsp; a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ... is an infinite sequence of integers such that a<sub>n</sub> - a<sub>m</sub> is divisible by n - m for all (unequal) n and m. For some polynomial p(x) we have p(n) &gt; |a<sub>n</sub>| for all n. Show that there is a polynomial q(x) such that q(n) = a<sub>n</sub> for all n.
