<b>Problem 3</b><br>

<p>

n digits, none of them 0, are randomly (and independently) generated, find the probability that their product is divisible by 10.<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: 1 - (8/9)<sup>n</sup> - (5/9)<sup>n</sup> + (4/9)<sup>n</sup>.

<p>

A number is divisible by 10 iff it has an even number and a 5 amongst its digits. The probability of no 5 is (8/9)<sup>n</sup>. The probability of no even number is (5/9)<sup>n</sup>. The probability of no 5 and no even number is (4/9)<sup>n</sup>. Hence result.
