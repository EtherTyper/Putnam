<b>Problem A1</b><br>

<p>

Let S be a set with 2002 elements and P the set of all its subsets. Prove that for any n (in the range from zero to |P|) we can color n elements of P white, and the rest black, so that the union of any two elements of P with the same color has the same color.

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let S have m elements and P be the set of its subsets. We show by induction on m that a coloring is possible for any n &le; |P|. If m = 1, we color both subsets black for n = 0, the empty set white (and the other subset black) for n = 1, and both subsets white for n = 2. Suppose now that a coloring is possible for m (and any n). Consider a set S with m+1 elements. Let b be any element of S. For n &le; 2<sup>m</sup>, use induction to color just n subsets of S - {b} white and color black all subsets of S which include b. Then the union of two white subsets is still a subset of S - {b} and hence (by assumption) white. The union of two black subsets of S - {b} is black for the same reason. If one black subset includes b, then so does the union, which must therefore be black. For n &gt; 2<sup>m</sup>,  we have 2<sup>m+1</sup> - n &lt; 2<sup>m</sup>, so we can find a coloring for 2<sup>m+1</sup> - n and then swap the colors.
