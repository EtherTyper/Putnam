<b>Problem 4</b><br>

<p>

Three chords of a sphere are meet at a point X inside the sphere but are not coplanar. A sphere through an endpoint of each chord and X touches the sphere through the other endpoints and X. Show that the chords have equal length.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let two of the chords be AB and CD. Take the plane containing them. In this plane we have a circle through A, B, C, D, and a circle through A, C, X which touches a circle through B, D, X at X. We show that AX = CX. Let the common tangent at X meet the larger circle at E and F. [Assume the points are in the order A, C, F, B, D, E as we go round the circle.] We have &ang;XAC = &ang;BAC (same angle) = &ang;BDC (circle ABCD) = &ang;BXF (XF tangent to BXD) = &ang;EXA (opposite angle) = &ang;XCA (EX tangent to AXC). So XAC is isosceles. So XA = XC. Similarly XB = XD. Hence AB = CD. 

<p>

Similarly, the other pairs of chords are equal.
