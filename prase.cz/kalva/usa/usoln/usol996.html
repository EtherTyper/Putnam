<b>Problem B3</b><br>

<p>

I is the incenter of the triangle ABC. The point D outside the triangle is such DA is parallel to BC and DB = AC, but ABCD is not a parallelogram. The angle bisector of BDC meets the line through I perpendicular to BC at X. The circumcircle of CDX meets the line BC again at Y. Show that DXY is isosceles.

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let IX meet BC at Z. Then using equal tangents, (BC - CZ) + (AC - CZ) = AB, so CZ = (AC + BC - AB)/2. Suppose the excircle opposite D of DBC touches BC at Z'. Then, again considering equal tangents, DB + (BC - CZ') = DC + CZ', so CZ' = (BD + BC - DC)/2 = (AC + BC - AB)/2 = CZ, so Z' and Z coincide. Since X lies on the perpendicular to BC at Z and on the bisector of &ang;BDC, it must also be the center of the excircle. Hence XC is the exterior bisector of &ang;BCD. So &ang;XCB = 90 - &ang;BCD/2. 

<p>

By construction, YDCX is cyclic, so &ang;YDX = &ang;YCX = &ang;XCB. Also &ang;BCD = &ang;YCD = &ang;YXD. Hence &ang;YDX = 90 - &ang;YXD/2. Hence YX = DX.
