<b>Problem B1</b><br>

<p>

ABC is a triangle. A circle through A and B meets the sides AC, BC at D, E respectively. The lines AB and DE meet at F. The lines BD and CF meet at M. Show that M is the midpoint of CF iff MB&middot;MD = MC<sup>2</sup>.

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

<p>

If MB&middot;MD = MC<sup>2</sup>, then BM/MC = CM/MD, so triangles CMD and BMC are similar, so &ang;MCD = &ang;MBC. But ABED is cyclic, so &ang;MBC = &ang;DAE, so AE is parallel to CF. But now we can reverse the argument, but "reflecting" about BM so that we interchange A and E, and C and F, to conclude that MB&middot;MD = MF<sup>2</sup>.
<p>
Suppose conversely that MC = MF. Applying Ceva's theorem to triangle BCF, we have that (BA/AF)(1)(CE/EB) = 1, so BA/AF = BE/EC so AE is parallel to CF. We can now use the argument above to show that MB&middot;MD = MC<sup>2</sup>.
