<b>Problem 1</b><br>

<p>

An obtuse angled triangle has integral sides and one acute angle is twice the other. Find the smallest possible perimeter.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: 77 = 16 + 28 + 33.

<p>

Let the triangle be ABC with angle A obtuse and angle B = 2 angle C. Let the sides be a, b, c as usual. Note that a &gt; b &gt; c. We have b sin C = c sin 2C and c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - 2ab sin C. Hence, b/2c = sin 2C/sin C = cos C = (a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>)/2ab. So ab<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup>c + b<sup>2</sup>c - c<sup>3</sup>. Hence b<sup>2</sup>(a - c) = c(a<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>). Dividing by a - c we get b<sup>2</sup> = c(a + c).

<p>

Now the triangle with smallest perimeter will have a, b, c relatively prime (otherwise we could divide by the common factor). Hence c must be a square. For if c and a+c have a common factor, then so do a and c and hence a, b and c, which means they cannot be the minimal set. Clearly c is not 1 (or the triangle would have nil area). c = 4 gives a = 5, which is too short, or a &ge; 21, which is too long. c = 9 gives a = 7 (too short), 18 (3 divides a, b, c), or &ge; 40 (too long). c = 16 gives a = 20 (too short) or a = 33 which works. Larger c gives a larger perimeter. Eg c = 25 gives a = 56, b = 45 (perimeter 126).
