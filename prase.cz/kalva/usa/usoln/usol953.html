<b>Problem 3</b><br>

<p>

The circumcenter O of the triangle ABC does not lie on any side or median. Let the midpoints of BC, CA, AB be L, M, N respectively. Take P, Q, R on the rays OL, OM, ON respectively so that &ang;OPA = &ang;OAL, &ang;OQB = &ang;OBM and &ang;ORC = &ang;OCN. Show that AP, BQ and CR meet at a point.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

We show that the circumcircle ABC is the incircle of PQR. Then (AR/AQ) (CQ/CP) (BP/BR) = 1 since AR = BR, AQ = CQ, BP = CP (equal tangents) and hence PA, QB, RC are concurrent by Ceva's theorem.

<p>

So let the tangents to the circumcircle at B and C meet at P'. It is sufficient to show that &ang;OP'A = &ang;OAL, for then it follows that P' = P (since there is obviously a unique point on the ray OL at which the segment OA subtends the &ang;OAL). 

<p>

This is curiously difficult to prove. Let LP' meet the circle at K. Then &ang;KCP' = &ang;KBC (P'C tangent) = &ang;KCB (KO perpendicular to BC, since L midpoint) = &ang;KCL (same angle). So KC bisects &ang;P'CL. Hence KP'/KL = CP'/CL. But obviously CP'/CL = BP'/BL. So K, C and B lie on the circle of Apollonius, the points X such that XP'/XL is constant. But A also lies on the circle of Apollonius. Hence KA bisects &ang;P'AL. (<i>See Canada 71/9 if you are not familiar with the circle of Apollonius.)</i> But &ang;OP'A + &ang;KAP' = &ang;OKA = &ang;OAK (OA and OK radii) = &ang;OAL + &ang;KAL. So &ang;OP'A = &ang;OAL.
