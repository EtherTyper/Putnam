<b>Problem 3</b><br>

<p>

Define the function f on the natural numbers by f(1) = 2, f(n) = 2<sup>f(n-1)</sup>. Show that f(n) has the same residue mod m for all sufficiently large n.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

This is the so-called tower of exponents, but HTML is not up showing it! The trick is to use induction on m (which is not at all obvious). The result is trivial for m = 1.

<p>

If m is even, then we can write m = 2<sup>a</sup>b, where b is odd. Then f(n) is eventually constant mod b. Obviously f(n) is eventually 0 mod 2<sup>a</sup>, so the residue mod m is eventually constant. 

<p>

If m is odd, then 2<sup>&phi;(m)</sup> = 1 mod m, where &phi;(m) &lt; m. So by induction f(n) is eventually constant mod &phi;(m). Hence f(n+1) = 2<sup>f(n)</sup> is eventually constant mod m.
