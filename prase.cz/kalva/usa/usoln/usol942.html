<b>Problem 2</b><br>

<p>

The sequence a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ... , a<sub>99</sub> has a<sub>1</sub> = a<sub>3</sub> = a<sub>5</sub> = ... = a<sub>97</sub> = 1, a<sub>2</sub> = a<sub>4</sub> = a<sub>6</sub> = ... = a<sub>98</sub> = 2, and a<sub>99</sub> = 3. We interpret subscripts greater than 99 by subtracting 99, so that a<sub>100</sub> means a<sub>1</sub> etc. An allowed move is to change the value of any one of the a<sub>n</sub> to another member of {1, 2, 3} different from its two neighbors, a<sub>n-1</sub> and a<sub>n+1</sub>. Is there a sequence of allowed moves which results in a<sub>m</sub> = a<sub>m+2</sub> = ... = a<sub>m+96</sub> = 1, a<sub>m+1</sub> = a<sub>m+3</sub> = ... = a<sub>m+95</sub> = 2, a<sub>m+97</sub> = 3, a<sub>n+98</sub> = 2 for some m? [So if m = 1, we have just interchanged the values of a<sub>98</sub> and a<sub>99</sub>.]

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

This is a classic invariant problem. We strongly suspect that there is no sequence of moves (otherwise it would be too easy to find), so that we must prove there is no sequence. The standard approach is to look for some invariant which is not changed by the allowed moves, but which is different for the initial and desired final positions.

<p>

For each member a<sub>i</sub> of the sequence let b<sub>i</sub> = 

<br>0 if a<sub>i</sub> = a<sub>i+1</sub>, 

<br>1 if (a<sub>i</sub>, a<sub>i+1</sub>) = (1, 2) , (2, 3) or (3, 1)

<br>-1 if (a<sub>i</sub>, a<sub>i+1</sub>) = (1, 3), (2, 1) or (3, 2).

<p>

We hope that b<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub> + ... + b<sub>99</sub>will be a suitable invariant. Suppose we make an allowed move by changing a<sub>i</sub>. That has the effect of changing just b<sub>i-1</sub> and b<sub>i</sub>. If a<sub>i-1</sub> = a<sub>i+1</sub>, then b<sub>i-1</sub> + b<sub>i</sub> = 0, so the total of the b<sub>j</sub> does not change. If a<sub>i-1</sub> does not equal a<sub>i+1</sub>, then we cannot change a<sub>i</sub> since it must be different from both. Thus allowed moves do not change b<sub>1</sub> + ... + b<sub>99</sub>. So it is an invariant. We now check it is suitable. The initial value is + 3 (there are 49 pairs (1,2), 48 pairs (2,1), 1 pair (2,3) and 1 pair (3,1) total 49 - 48 + 1 + 1 = 3. But the desired final position has value -3 (it has 48 pairs (1, 2), 49 pairs (2, 1), 1 pair (1, 3) and 1 pair (3, 2), total 48 - 49 - 1 - 1 = - 3). So we cannot get from one to the other by allowed moves.
