<b>Problem 3</b><br>

<p>

You are told that all integers from 33 to 73 inclusive can be expressed as a sum of positive integers whose reciprocals sum to 1. Show that the same is true for all integers greater than 73.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

The trick is consider the integers 2a<sub>1</sub>, 2a<sub>2</sub>, ... , 2a<sub>m</sub> given that a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>,  ... , a<sub>m</sub> is a solution for n. The sum of their reciprocals is 1/2. So if we throw in two 4s, we get a solution for 2n + 8. Similarly, adjoining 3 and 6 gives a solution for 2n + 9. It is now a simple induction. For the starter set gives 74 thru 155, then those give 156 thru 319, and so on. In general, n thru 2n+7 gives 2n+8 thru 4n+23 = 2(2n+8) + 7.
