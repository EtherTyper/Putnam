<b>Problem 5</b><br>

<p>

A graph with n points and k edges has no triangles. Show that it has a point P such that there are at most k(1 - 4k/n<sup>2</sup>) edges between points not joined to P (by an edge).

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Given a point P, the edges of the graph can be divided into three categories: (1) edges PQ, (2) edges QQ', where Q is joined to P, and (3) edges Q'Q", where Q' and Q" are not joined to P. Note that if Q is joined to P and there is an edge QQ', then Q' cannot be joined to P, or PQQ' would be a triangle. So the total number of edges in categories (1) and (2) is &sum;' deg Q, where &sum;' indicates that the sum is taken over points Q which are joined to P (by an edge). Thus the total number of edges in category (3) is k - &sum;' deg Q. So we have to show that for some P, &sum;' deg Q &ge; 4k<sup>2</sup>/n<sup>2</sup>.

<p>

The total for all points P is &sum;<sub>P</sub>&sum;' deg Q. If we invert the order of the summations, this becomes  &sum; deg<sup>2</sup>Q, where the sum is over all points Q. Now by Cauchy, (&sum; deg Q)<sup>2</sup> &le; (&sum; 1<sup>2</sup>)(&sum; deg<sup>2</sup>Q) = n &sum; deg<sup>2</sup>Q. But &sum; deg Q = 2k, so &sum; deg<sup>2</sup>Q &ge; 4k<sup>2</sup>/n and hence &sum;<sub>P</sub>&sum;' deg Q &ge; 4k<sup>2</sup>/n. But if a sum of n terms is at least 4k<sup>2</sup>/n, then at least one for the terms must be at least 4k<sup>2</sup>/n<sup>2</sup>. In other words, there is a point P such that &sum;' deg Q &ge; 4k<sup>2</sup>/n<sup>2</sup>, as required.
