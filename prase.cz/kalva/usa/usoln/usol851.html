<b>Problem 1</b><br>

<p>

Do there exist 1985 distinct positive integers such that the sum of their squares is a cube and the sum of their cubes is a square?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: yes.

<p>

Take <i>any</i> n integers a<sub>i</sub>. Suppose that &sum; a<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> = b and &sum; a<sub>i</sub><sup>3</sup> = c. Now multiply each a<sub>i</sub> by b<sup>4</sup>c<sup>3</sup>. The sum of their squares becomes b<sup>9</sup>c<sup>6</sup> which is a cube and the sum of their cubes becomes b<sup>12</sup>c<sup>10</sup> which is a square.
