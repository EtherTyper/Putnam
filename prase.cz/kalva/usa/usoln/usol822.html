<b>Problem 2</b><br>

<p>

Show that if m, n are positive integers such that (x<sup>m+n</sup> + y<sup>m+n</sup> + z<sup>m+n</sup>)/(m+n) = (x<sup>m</sup> + y<sup>m</sup> + z<sup>m</sup>)/m (x<sup>n</sup> + y<sup>n</sup> + z<sup>n</sup>)/n for all real x, y, z with sum 0, then {m, n} = {2, 3} or {2, 5}.

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Put z = - x  - y. If m and n are both odd, the lhs has a term in x<sup>m+n</sup> but the rhs does not. So at least one of m and n is even. Suppose both are even. Then comparing terms in x<sup>m+n</sup> we get 2/(m+n) = 4/mn. Put m = 2M, n = 2N, then MN = M+N. So M must divide N and N must divide M. Hence M = N = 2. So m = n = 4. But put x = y = 1, z = -2, the lhs is (1 + 1 + 256)/8 = 129/4 and the rhs is ( (1 + 1 + 16)/4)<sup>2</sup> = 81/4. So one of m, n must be odd and the other even. Without loss of generality we may take m odd.

<p>

Comparing the terms in x<sup>m+n-1</sup>y, the coefficient on the lhs is 1. On the rhs it is 1 x 2/n. So we must have n = 2. Put x = y = 1, z = -2. We get lhs = (1 + 1 - 2<sup>m+2</sup>)/(m+2) and rhs = (1 + 1 + 4)/2 x (1 + 1 - 2<sup>m</sup>)/m. So (6 - m)2<sup>m-1</sup>= 2m+6. We cannot have m &gt; 6 or the lhs is negative. Trying m = 1, 3, 5 we find that 3 and 5 are the only solutions.

<p>

Arguably, we still have to verify that m=3, n=2 and m=5, n=2 are solutions. That is just tedious algebra. [We do have equality for those values.]
