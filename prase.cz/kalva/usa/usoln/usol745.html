<b>Problem 5</b><br>

<p>

A point inside an equilateral triangle with side 1 is a distance a, b, c from the vertices. The triangle ABC has BC = a, CA = b, AB = c. The sides subtend equal angles at a point inside it. Show that sum of the distances of the point from the vertices is 1.

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let D be the point inside ABC, so that &ang;ADB = &ang;BDC = 120<sup>o</sup>. The key is to start from ABC and to rotate the triangle BDC through 60<sup>o</sup> away from the triangle ADB. After that everything is routine.

<p>

Suppose D goes to D' and C to C'. Then BD = BD' and &ang;DBD' = 60<sup>o</sup>, so BDD' is equilateral. Hence &ang;D'DB = 60<sup>o</sup>. &ang;BDA = 120<sup>o</sup>, so ADD' is a straight line. Also &ang;DD'B = 60<sup>o</sup> and &ang;C'D'B = 120<sup>o</sup>, so DD'C' is a straight line. Thus AC' has length DA + DB + DC. 

<p>

Note that BC = BC' and &ang;CBC' = 60<sup>o</sup>, so CBC' is equilateral. Hence &ang;CC'B = 60<sup>o</sup>. Now take Y such that AC'Y is equilateral, Y is on the opposite side of AC' to C. Then &ang;BC'Y = 60<sup>o</sup> - &ang;AC'B = &ang;CC'A. Also BC' = CC' and YC' = AC', so triangles BC'Y and CC'A are congruent. Hence BY = CA = b. Also BC' = BC = a and BA = c. Thus B is a point inside an equilateral triangle and distances a, b, c from the vertices. Hence the triangle must have side 1. So DA + DB + DC = AC' = 1.
