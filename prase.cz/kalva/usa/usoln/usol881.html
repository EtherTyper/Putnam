<b>Problem 1</b><br>

<p>

The repeating decimal 0.ab ... k <u>pq ... u</u> = m/n, where m and n are relatively prime integers, and there is at least one decimal before the repeating part. Show that n is divisible by 2 or 5 (or both). [For example, 0.011<u>36</u> = 0.01136363636 ... = 1/88 and 88 is divisible by 2.]

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Note that k and u are not equal (otherwise we should have regarded the repeating part as starting at k). We have m/n = ab...k/10<sup>r</sup> pq...u/(10<sup>r</sup>(10<sup>s</sup> - 1) ) = (ab...k (10<sup>s</sup> - 1) + pq...u)/(10<sup>r</sup>(10<sup>s</sup> - 1) ). The numerator = u - k mod 10, which is non-zero, so the numerator is not divisible by 10. But the denominator is divisible by 10. Hence after reduction to lowest terms the denominator is divisible by 2 or 5 or both.
