<b>Problem 5</b><br>

<p>

X is a set of n positive integers with sum s and product p. Show for any integer N &gt;= s, &sum;( parity(Y) (N - sum(Y))Cs ) = p, where aCb is the binomial coefficient a!/(b! (a-b)! ), the sum is taken over all subsets Y of X, parity(Y) = 1 if Y is empty or has an even number of elements, -1 if Y has an odd number of elements, and sum(Y) is the sum of the elements in Y.

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

(&sum; (-1)<sup>n</sup> binomial) with the sum over all subsets Y of a set X strongly suggests the principle of inclusion and exclusion. 

<p>

Consider all sequences of length N &ge; s of 0s and 1s with a total of s 1s. We can regard positions 1, 2, ... , a<sub>1</sub> as block a<sub>1</sub>, positions a<sub>1</sub> + 1, a<sub>2</sub> + 2, ... , a<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub> as block a<sub>2</sub>, positions a<sub>1</sub>+a<sub>2</sub> + 1, a<sub>1</sub>+a<sub>2</sub> + 2, ... , a<sub>1</sub>+a<sub>2</sub> + a<sub>3</sub> as block a<sub>3</sub>, and so on up to a<sub>1</sub> + ... + a<sub>n-1</sub> + 1, ... a<sub>1</sub> + ... + a<sub>n</sub> as block a<sub>n</sub>. We are interested in sequences which have just one 1 in each block. Counting directly there are obviously just p such sequences. 

<p>

But we can also take N' to be the total number of sequences of 0s and 1s with s 1s and N<sub>Y</sub> to be the number with no 1s in block k for k in Y, where Y is a subset of X. Requiring one 1 in each block is equivalent to requiring no block to have no 1s. So the PIE gives that p = N' - N<sub>Y</sub> for Y with one element + N<sub>Y</sub> for Y with 2 elements and so on. N' = NCs and N<sub>Y</sub> = (N - sum(Y))Cs, so we have p = &sum;( parity(Y) (N - sum(Y))Cs ), which is the required relation.
