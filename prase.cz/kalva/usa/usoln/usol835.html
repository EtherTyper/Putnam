<b>Problem 5</b><br>

<p>

Prove that an open interval of length 1/n in the real line contains at most (n+1)/2 rational points p/q with 1 &le; q &le; n.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

This is a variant on the familiar result that m+1 integers from {1, 2, ... , 2m} must include one which divides another. To prove that, take the largest odd divisor of each of the m+1 integers. That gives us m+1 odd numbers from {1, 3, ... , 2m-1}, so by the pigeonhole principle we must have some odd integer b twice. If the corresponding integers are 2<sup>h</sup>b and 2<sup>k</sup>b, then one must divide the other.

<p>

Now if 1&le; q &le; n and 1 &le; kq &le; n, then |p/q - p'/kq| &ge; 1/kq &ge; 1/n. But we cannot have two such points in an <i>open</i> interval of length 1/n. Obviously we cannot have two points with the same denominator, so if n = 2m, there are at most m points and if n = 2m+1 there are at most m+1 points.
