<b>Problem 5</b><br>

<p>

A partition of n is an increasing sequence of integers with sum n. For example, the partitions of 5 are: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 4; 5; 1, 2, 2; and 2, 3. If p is a partition, f(p) = the number of 1s in p, and g(p) = the number of distinct integers in the partition. Show that &sum; f(p) = &sum; g(p), where the sum is taken over all partitions of n.

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let &pi;(n) be the number of partitions of n. If p = a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ... , a<sub>m</sub> is a partition of n, then h(p) = 1, a<sub>1</sub>, ... , a<sub>m</sub> is a partition of n+1 which contains a 1. Moreover, h is obviously a bijection between partitions of n and partitions of n+1 which contain a 1. But h(p) also contains one more 1 than p, so &sum; f(p) for n+1 is &sum; f(p) for n plus &pi;(n). Thus &sum; f(p) for n is 1 + &pi;(1) + &pi;(2) + ... + &pi;(n-1). [Obviously &sum; f(p) for n = 1 is 1.]

<p>

Checking, we find &pi;(1) = 1, &pi;(2) = 2, &pi;(3) = 3, &pi;(4) = 5, &pi;(5) = 7. So this formula gives &sum; f(p) for n = 5 is 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12, which is correct.

<p>

Now fix n and consider the number of pairs (p, m), where p is a partition of n containing m. For each p the number of such pairs is g(p). So the total number of such pairs &sum; g(p). But the number of pairs (p, m) for fixed m is just &pi;(n - m) (taking &pi;(0) = 0). So the total is also &sum; &pi;(n - m). So &sum; g(p) = 1 + &pi;(1) + ... + &pi;(n-1) = &sum; f(p).
