<b>Problem 1</b><br>

<p>

Show that if two points lie inside a regular tetrahedron the angle they subtend at a vertex is less than &pi;/3.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let the tetrahedron be ABCD and the points be P and Q. Note that we are asked to prove the result for <i>any</i> vertex, not just some. So consider angle PAQ. Let the rays AP, AQ meet the plane BCD at P', Q' respectively. So we have to show that angle P'AQ' &lt; 60<sup>o</sup> for P' and Q' interior points of the triangle BCD. Extend P'Q' to meet the sides of the triangle at X and Y. Without loss of generality, X lies BC and Y lies on CD. Obviously if is sufficient to show that angle XAY &lt; 60<sup>o</sup>.

<p>

X and Y cannot both be vertices (or P', Q' would not have been interior points of the triangle and hence P and Q would not have been strictly <i>inside</i> the tetrahedron). So suppose X is not a vertex. We show that XY &lt;= XD. Consider triangle XYD. &ang;XDY &lt; &ang;BDC = 60<sup>o</sup>, but &ang;XYD = &ang;XCD + &ang;CXY &ge; 60<sup>o</sup>, so &ang;XDY &lt; &ang;XYD. Hence XY &le; XD. But XD = AX (consider, for example, the congruent triangles AXB and DXB). Hence XY &lt; AX. Similarly, XY &le; AY. Hence angle XAY &lt; 60<sup>o</sup>.
