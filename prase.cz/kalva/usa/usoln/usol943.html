<b>Problem 3</b><br>

<p>

The hexagon ABCDEF has the following properties: (1) its vertices lie on a circle; (2) AB = CD = EF; and (3) the diagonals AD, BE, CF meet at a point. Let X be the intersection of AD and CE. Show that CX/XE = (AC/CE)<sup>2</sup>.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let the diagonals AD, BE, CF meet at Y. We show first that the triangles AEC, YED are similar. &ang;ACE = &ang;ADE (ACDE circle) = YDE (same angle). &ang;AEB = &ang;CED (AB = CD), so &ang;AEB + &ang;BEC = &ang;CED + &ang;BEC or &ang;AEC = &ang;YED. So AEC and YED are similar, so AC/CE = YD/DE.

<p>

We next show that AEC and CDY are similar. &ang;AEC = &ang;ADC (circle) = &ang;CDY (same angle). &ang;EAC = &ang;EAD + &ang;DAC = &ang;ECD (circle) + &ang;ECF (EF = CD) = &ang;DCY. So AEC and CDY are similar. So AC/CE = CY/YD.

<p>

Hence (AC/CE)<sup>2</sup> = CY/DE. Finally we show that CXY and EXD are similar. That is almost obvious because CF is parallel to DE since CD = EF. Hence CY/DE = CX/XE, which gives the required result.
