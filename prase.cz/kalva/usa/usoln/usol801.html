<b>Problem 1</b><br>

<p>

A balance has unequal arms and pans of unequal weight. It is used to weigh two objects of unequal weight. The first object balances against a weight A, when placed in the left pan and against a weight a, when placed in the right pan. The corresponding weights for the second object are B and b. A third object balances against a weight C, when placed in the left pan. What is its true weight?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

The effect of the unequal arms and pans is that if an object of weight x in the left pan balances an object of weight y in the right pan, then x = hy + k for some constants h and k. Thus if the first object has true weight x, then x = hA + k, a = hx + k. So a = h<sup>2</sup>A + (h+1)k. Similarly, b = h<sup>2</sup>B + (h+1)k. Subtracting gives h<sup>2</sup> = (a - b)/(A - B). and hence (h+1)k = a - h<sup>2</sup>A = (bA - aB)/(A - B).

<p>

The true weight of the third object is thus hC + k = &radic;( (a-b)/(A-B) ) C + (bA - aB)/(A - B) 1/(&radic;( (a-b)/(A-B) ) + 1).
