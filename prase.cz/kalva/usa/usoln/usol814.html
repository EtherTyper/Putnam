<b>Problem 4</b><br>

<p>

A convex polygon has n sides. Each vertex is joined to a point P not in the same plane. If A, B, C are adjacent vertices of the polygon take the angle between the planes PBA and PBC. The sum of the n such angles equals the sum of the n angles subtended at P by the sides of the polygon (such as the angle APB). Show that n = 3.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

n = 3 is certainly possible. For example, take &ang;APB = &ang;APC = &ang;BPC = 90<sup>o</sup> (so that the lines PA, PB, PC are mutually perpendicular). Then the three planes through P are also mutually perpendicular, so the two sums are both 270<sup>o</sup>.

<p>

We show that n &gt; 3 is not possible. 

<p>

The sum of the n angles APB etc at P is less than 360<sup>o</sup>. This is almost obvious. Take another plane which meets the lines PA, PB, PC etc at A', B', C', ... and so that the foot of the perpendicular from P to the plane lies <i>inside</i> the n-gon A'B'C' ... then as we move P down the perpendicular the angles A'PB' etc all increase. But when it reaches the plane their sum is 360<sup>o</sup>. However, I do not immediately see how to make that rigorous. Instead, take any point O inside the n-gon ABC... . We have &ang;PBA + &ang;PBC &gt; &ang;ABC. Adding the n such equations we get &sum;(180<sup>o</sup> - APB) &gt; &sum; ABC = (n - 2) 180<sup>o</sup>. So &sum; APB &lt; 360<sup>o</sup>.

<p>

The sum of the n angles between the planes is at least (n - 2) 180<sup>o</sup>. If we take a sphere center P. Then the lines PA, PB intersect it at A", B", ... which form a spherical polygon. The angles of this polygon are the angles between the planes. We can divide the polygon into n - 2 triangles. The angles in a spherical triangle sum to <i>at least</i> 180<sup>o</sup>. So the angles in the spherical polygon are at least (n - 2) 180<sup>o</sup>. So we have (n - 2) 180<sup>o</sup> &lt; 360<sup>o</sup> and hence n &lt; 4.
