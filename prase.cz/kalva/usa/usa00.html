<b>A2.</b>&nbsp; The incircle of the triangle ABC touches BC, CA, AB at D, E, F respectively. We have AF &le; BD &le; CE, the inradius is r and we have 2/AF + 5/BD + 5/CE = 6/r. Show that ABC is isosceles and find the lengths of its sides if r = 4.

<b>A3.</b>&nbsp; A player starts with A blue cards, B red cards and C white cards. He scores points as he plays each card. If he plays a blue card, his score is the number of white cards remaining in his hand. If he plays a red card it is three times the number of blue cards remaining in his hand. If he plays a white card, it is twice the number of red cards remaining in his hand. What is the lowest possible score as a function of A, B and C and how many different ways can it be achieved?
