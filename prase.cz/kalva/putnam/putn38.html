<b>A1.</b>&nbsp; A solid in Euclidean 3-space extends from z = -h/2 to z = +h/2 and the area of the section z = k is a polynomial in k of degree at most 3. Show that the volume of the solid is h(B + 4M + T)/6, where B is the area of the bottom (z = -h/2), M is the area of the middle section (z = 0), and T is the area of the top (z = h/2). Derive the formulae for the volumes of a cone and a sphere.

<b>A2.</b>&nbsp; A solid has a cylindrical middle with a conical cap at each end. The height of each cap equals the length of  the middle. For a given surface area, what shape maximizes the volume?

<b>A3.</b>&nbsp; A particle moves in the Euclidean plane. At time t (taking all real values) its coordinates are x = t<sup>3</sup> - t and y = t<sup>4</sup> + t. Show that its velocity has a maximum at t = 0, and that its path has an inflection at t = 0.

<b>A4.</b>&nbsp; A notch is cut in a cylindrical vertical tree trunk. The notch penetrates to the axis of the cylinder and is bounded by two half-planes. Each half-plane is bounded by a horizontal line passing through the axis of the cylinder. The angle between the two half-planes is &theta;. Prove that the volume of the notch is minimized (for given tree and &theta;) by taking the bounding planes at equal angles to the horizontal plane.

Let d = det(A), and let A<sub>ij</sub> be the cofactor of a<sub>ij</sub>, that is, the determinant of the 3 x 3 matrix formed from A by deleting a<sub>ij</sub> and other elements in the same row and column. Let B be the 4 x 4 matrix (A<sub>ij</sub>) and let D be det B. Prove D = d<sup>3</sup>.

<p>(2) &nbsp; Let P(x) be the quadratic Ax<sup>2</sup> + Bx + C. Suppose that P(x) = x has unequal real roots. Show that the roots are also roots of P(P(x)) = x. Find a quadratic equation for the other two roots of this equation. Hence solve (y<sup>2</sup> - 3y + 2)<sup>2</sup> - 3(y<sup>2</sup> - 3y + 2) + 2 - y = 0.

The Putnam fellow was Irving Kaplansky. To avoid possible copyright problems, I have changed the <i>wording</i>, but not the <i>substance</i>, of all the problems. The original text and solutions are available in: A M Gleason, R E Greenwood & L M Kelly, The William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, Problems and Solutions, 1938-1964, MAA 1980. Out of print, but available in some university libraries.
