The Putnam fellow was Harvey Cohn. To avoid possible copyright problems, I have changed the <i>wording</i>, but not the <i>substance</i>, of all the problems. The original text and solutions are available in: A M Gleason, R E Greenwood & L M Kelly, The William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, Problems and Solutions, 1938-1964, MAA 1980. Out of print, but available in some university libraries.
