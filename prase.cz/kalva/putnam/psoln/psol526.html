<b>Problem A6</b><br>

<p>

Prove that there are only finitely many cuboidal blocks with integer sides a x b x c, such that if the block is painted on the outside and then cut into unit cubes, exactly half the cubes have no face painted.

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

It is sufficient to show that abc = 2(a - 2)(b -2)(c - 2) has only finitely many solutions in integers c &le; b &le; a. If c &le; 4, then c &ge; 2(c - 2), but ab &gt; (a - 2)(b - 2), so there are no solutions. If c &ge; 10, then c/(c - 2) &le; 10/8, so D &le; 125/64 &lt; 2, where for convenience we have written abc/( (a - 2)(b - 2)(c - 2) ) as D, so there are no solutions. Hence c = 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

<p>

If c = 5 and b &ge; 24, then D &le; 5/3 (24/22)<sup>2</sup> &lt; 2, so there are no solutions. Now a/(a - 2) is strictly monotonic decreasing, so there is at most one solution for given b, c. Hence there are only finitely many solutions for c = 5.

<p>

Similarly, for c = 6, we find that are only solutions for b &lt; 16; for c = 7, we find b &lt; 14; for c = 8, b &lt; 12 and for c = 9, b &lt; 12. Hence there are only finitely many solutions in each case.
