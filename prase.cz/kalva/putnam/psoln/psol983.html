<b>Problem A3</b><br>

<p>

Let R be the reals. Let f <b>:</b> R &rarr; R have a continuous third derivative. Show that there is a point a with f(a) f '(a) f ''(a) f '''(a) &ge; 0.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

<i>Straightforward.</i>

<p>

If any of f, f ', f '', f ''' change sign, then we are done. We show that if f, f ' and f '' do not change sign, then f and f '' have the same sign. Suppose f '' is positive. Then f(x) = f(0) + f '(0) x + f ''(c) x<sup>2</sup>/2 for some c, so for all x, f(x) &gt; f(0) + f '(0) x. That is certainly positive for x sufficiently large and of the same sign as f '(0). Hence it is positive for all x. Similarly, if f '' is negative, then f is negative. Hence f(x)f ''(x) &ge; 0 for all x. Similarly f '(x)f '''(x) &ge; 0 for all x.
