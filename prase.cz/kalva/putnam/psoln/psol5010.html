<b>Problem B4</b><br>

<p>

A long, light cylinder has elliptical cross-section with semi-axes a &gt; b. It lies on the ground with its main axis horizontal and the major axes horizontal. A thin heavy wire of the same length as the cylinder is attached to the line along the top of the cylinder. [We could take the cylinder to be the surface |x| &le; L, y<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup> = 1. Contact with the ground is along |x| &le; L, y = 0, z = -b. The wire is along |x| &le; L, y = 0, z = b.] For what values of b/a is the cylinder in stable equilibrium?

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Take the ellipse to be x<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup> = 1. We need the normal to the ellipse at a point near (0, -b) to meet the y-axis above (0, b) (because then the heavy wire will be the correct side of the vertical through the point of contact to right the cylinder).

<p>

The gradient at (a cos t, b sin t) is -b/a cot t, so the normal has slope a/b tan t, so its equation is (y - b sin t) = a/b tan t (x - a cos t). This meets the y-axis at y = b sin t - a<sup>2</sup>/b sin t. For points near (0, -b), sin t is -(1 - &epsilon;) so we need a<sup>2</sup>/b - b &gt; b or a &gt; b&radic;2.
