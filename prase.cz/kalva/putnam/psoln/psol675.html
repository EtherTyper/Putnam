<b>Problem A5</b><br>

<p>

K is a convex, finite or infinite, region of the plane, whose boundary is a union of a finite number of straight line segments. Its area is at least &pi;/4. Show that we can find points P, Q in K such that PQ = 1.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Suppose the result is false, so that the maximum distance is 2d &lt; 1. Take a diameter of K (in other words two points A, B for which AB = 2d). Let the x-axis lie along this diameter with the origin at its midpoint. Take the y-axis perpendicular to the x-axis as usual. Then K lies entirely between x = -d and x = +d. Let t(x) be the top boundary of K (above the x-axis) and -b(x) be the bottom boundary of K (below the x-axis).

<p>

The area A of K is the area under the curve t(x) plus the area between b(x) and the x-axis. In other words A = &int;<sub>-d</sub><sup>d</sup> t(x) dx + &int;<sub>-d</sub><sup>d</sup> b(x) dx = &int;<sub>-d</sub><sup>d</sup> t(x) dx + &int;<sub>-d</sub><sup>d</sup> b(-x) dx = &int;<sub>-d</sub><sup>d</sup>( t(x) + b(-x) ) dx. Now (t(x) + b(-x))<sup>2</sup> = D<sup>2</sup> - (2x)<sup>2</sup>, where D is the distance between the two points (x, t(x)) and (-x, b(-x)). Certainly, D &lt; 1, so &int;<sub>-d</sub><sup>d</sup>( t(x) + b(-x) ) dx &lt; &int;<sub>-d</sub><sup>d</sup> &radic;( 1 - 4x<sup>2</sup> ) dx.

<p>

The indefinite integral is 1/2 &radic;( 1 - 4x<sup>2</sup>) + (1/4) sin<sup>-1</sup>(2x), so integrated between -1/2 and 1/2 it gives &pi;/4. The integrand is positive, so between -d and d it gives a smaller result. In other words we have established that if 2d &lt; 1, then A &lt; &pi;/4. Contradiction.
