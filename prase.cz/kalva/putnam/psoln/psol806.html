<b>Problem A6</b><br>

<p>

Let R be the reals and C the set of all functions f <b>:</b> [0, 1] &rarr; R with a continuous derivative and satisfying f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1. Find inf<sub>C</sub> &int;<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup> | f '(x) - f(x) | dx.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

If it were not for the condition f(0) = 0, we could arrange for the infimum to be zero (which is obviously the lowest possible value), by taking f(x) = e<sup>x-1</sup>. It is tempting to think that we can adjust this solution (and keep zero inf) by taking f(x) = e<sup>x-1</sup> for [&epsilon;, 1] and kx for [0, &epsilon;]. However, this does not work because &int;<sub>0</sub><sup>&epsilon;</sup> f '(x) dx = f(&epsilon;) = 1/e. 

<p>

We need the following (familiar) trick: (f(x) e<sup>-x</sup>)' = (f '(x) - f(x) ) e<sup>-x</sup>. So &int;<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup> | f '(x) - f(x) | dx = &int;<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup> | e<sup>x</sup> (f(x) e<sup>-x</sup>)' | dx &ge; &int;<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup> | (f(x) e<sup>-x</sup>)' | dx &ge; &int;<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup> (f(x) e<sup>-x</sup>)' dx = f(1) e<sup>-1</sup> - f(0) e<sup>0</sup> = 1/e.

<p>

Finally, we just need to improve slightly our opening example. The integral of f(x) over [0, &epsilon;] will be arbitrarily small for small &epsilon;. But derivative is discontinuous at &epsilon;. However, we can fix that by taking f(x) to be an arbitrary monotonic increasing function with the required values at 0 and &epsilon; and with the required derivative at &epsilon;.
