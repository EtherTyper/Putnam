<b>Problem B3</b><br>

<p>

Let O be the origin (0, 0) and C the line segment { (x, y) <b>:</b> x &isin; [1, 3], y = 1 }. Let K be the curve { P <b>:</b> for some Q &isin; C, P lies on OQ and PQ = 0.01 }. Let k be the length of the curve K. Is k greater or less than 2?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: less.

<p>

If we use polar coordinates, then r = cosec &theta; - .01, so the length is &int;<sub>&pi;/4</sub><sup>arctan(1/3)</sup> &radic;( (cosec &theta; - .01)<sup>2</sup> + cosec<sup>2</sup>&theta;cot<sup>2</sup>&theta;) d&theta;. This is obviously horrendous.

<p>

The trick is that if we just remove the .01, then the integral gives the curve length for the line segment C, which is 2. But the presence of the -.01 obviously <i>reduces</i> the integrand at every point of the range, so the integral above must have value <i>less</i> than 2.

<p>

<i>Comment. One hopes, of course, that the questioner has made it easy by taking the two endpoints a distance greater than 2 apart, or maybe the sum of the distances from each endpoint to the middle greater than 2 (although that is already getting tiresome to check). But no. Or maybe the difference in x-coordinates + the difference in y-coordinates for the endpoints is less than 2 (because the curve length is surely less). But no. I wasted time on all those!</i>
