<b>Problem B4</b><br>

<p>

A is the 2 x 2 matrix (a<sub>ij</sub>) with a<sub>11</sub> = a<sub>22</sub> = 3, a<sub>12</sub> = 2, a<sub>21</sub> = 4 and I is the 2 x 2 unit matrix. Show that the greatest common divisor of the entries of A<sup>n</sup> - I tends to infinity.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

It is a trivial induction that A<sup>n</sup> has the form (c<sub>ij</sub>), where c<sub>11</sub> = r, c<sub>12</sub> = s, c<sub>21</sub> = 2s, c<sub>22</sub> = r, with r an odd integer which tends to infinity with n (for example, r &gt; 2<sup>n</sup>), and s an even integer. Hence the gcd of the entries of A<sup>n</sup> - I is the gcd of r - 1 and s. Also det A = 1, hence det(A<sup>n</sup>) = 1 and so r<sup>2</sup> - 2s<sup>2</sup> = 1, or (r - 1)(r + 1) = 2s<sup>2</sup>. It follows that the gcd of r - 1 and s is either &radic;(r - 1) or &radic;(2r - 2). [If p is an odd prime and h is the highest power of p that divides r - 1, then p does not divide r + 1, and so h must be even and h/2 the highest power of p dividing n. Both r - 1 and r + 1 are even, but one is not divisible by 4. If h is the highest power of 2 dividing the other, then h must be even and h/2 is the highest power of 2 dividing n.] But r - 1 tends to infinity with n, so the gcd does also.
