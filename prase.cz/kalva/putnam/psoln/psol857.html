<b>Problem B1</b><br>

<p>

p(x) is a polynomial of degree 5 with 5 distinct integral roots. What is the smallest number of non-zero coefficients it can have? Give a possible set of roots for a polynomial achieving this minimum.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: 3. For example: 0, &plusmn;1, &plusmn;2.

<p>

The example given has three non-zero coefficients: x(x<sup>2</sup> - 1)(x<sup>2</sup> - 4) = x<sup>5</sup> - 5x<sup>3</sup> + 4x. So we have to show that two coefficients are not possible.

<p>

The polynomial cannot be x<sup>5</sup> + ax<sup>n</sup> with n &gt; 1, because it would then have 0 as a repeated root and hence less than 5 distinct roots. x<sup>5</sup> + ax has at most 3 real roots, and x<sup>5</sup> + a has only one real root.
