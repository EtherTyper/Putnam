<b>Problem B3</b><br>

<p>

ABCD is an arbitrary tetrahedron. The inscribed sphere touches ABC at S, ABD at R, ACD at Q and BCD at P. Show that the four sets of angles {ASB, BSC, CSA}, {ARB, BRD, DRA}, {AQC, CQD, DQA}, {BPC, CPD, DPB} are the same.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

The key is to notice that the two angles in the sets subtended by the same side of the tetrahedron are the same. For example &ang;ASC = &ang;AQC. Let O be the centre of the sphere and r its radius. Then AQ<sup>2</sup> + r<sup>2 = </sup>AO<sup>2</sup> = AS<sup>2</sup> + r<sup>2</sup>, so AQ = AS. Similarly, CQ = CS. So the triangles AQC, ASC are similar.

<p>

Now the sum of the angles in each set is the same. But &ang;ASB in the first set equals &ang;ARB in the second set, so &ang;BSC + &ang;CSA = &ang;BRD + &ang;DRA. Similarly, &ang;CQD in the third set equals &ang;CPD in the fourth, so &ang;AQC + &ang;DQA = &ang;BPC + &ang;DPB. Adding these two equations and using &ang;BSC = &ang;BPC, &ang;CSA = &ang;AQC, &ang;BRD = &ang;DPB, &ang;DRA = &ang;DQA gives &ang;CSA = &ang;BRD. In other words, the angles in the set subscribed by opposite sides of the tetrahedron are also the same.

<p>

That gives us all we need: &ang;ASC = &ang;BRD = &ang;AQC = &ang;BPD; &ang;ASB = &ang;ARB = &ang;CQD = &ang;CPD; &ang;BSC = &ang;ARD = &ang;AQD = &ang;BPC.
