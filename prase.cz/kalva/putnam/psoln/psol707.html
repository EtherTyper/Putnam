<b>Problem B1</b><br>

<p>

Let f(n) = (n<sup>2</sup> + 1)(n<sup>2</sup> + 4)(n<sup>2</sup> + 9) ... (n<sup>2</sup> + (2n)<sup>2</sup>). Find lim<sub>n&rarr;&infin;</sub> f(n)<sup>1/n</sup>/n<sup>4</sup>.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Rearranging slightly, we may take g(n) = (1 + (1/n)<sup>2</sup>)(1 + (2/n)<sup>2</sup>)(1 + (3/n)<sup>2</sup>) ... (1 + (2n/n)<sup>2</sup>). We have to find lim g(n)<sup>1/n</sup>.

<p>

It is a mistake to approach this algebraically. It is not hard to show that the product of the pair of terms r and 2n+1-r is at least 4. There are n such pairs, so certainly g(n)<sup>1/n</sup> &gt; 4, but it is hard to get any further.

<p>

The key is to take logs. We then see immediately that g(n)<sup>1/n</sup> becomes a standard Riemann sum for &int;<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> log(1 + x<sup>2</sup>) dx. So the limit is simply the integral.

<p>

x log(1 + x<sup>2</sup>) differentiates to log(1 + x<sup>2</sup>) + 2x<sup>2</sup>/(1 + x<sup>2</sup>). A little reflection then suggests using 2 tan<sup>-1</sup>x, which differentiates to 2/(1 + x<sup>2</sup>). So the complete integral is x log(1 + x<sup>2</sup>) + 2 tan<sup>-1</sup>x - 2x. Evaluating between 0 and 2 gives 2 log 5 + 2 tan<sup>-1</sup>2 - 4 = k, say. Then the original limit in the question is e<sup>k</sup>. That is approximately 4.192.
