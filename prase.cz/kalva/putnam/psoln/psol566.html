<b>Problem A6</b><br>

<p>

Let R be the reals. Find f <b>:</b> R &rarr; R which preserves all rational distances but not all distances. Show that if f <b>:</b> R<sup>2</sup> &rarr; R<sup>2</sup> preserves all rational distances then it preserves all distances.

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let f(x) = x for x rational, x + 1 for x irrational. If x - y is rational, then either both x and y are rational in which case f(x) - f(y) = x - y, or neither are in which case f(x) - f(y) = (x + 1) - (y + 1) = x - y. So f preserves rational distances. But f does not preserve all distances. For example f(&radic;2) - f(0) &ne; &radic;2 - 0.

<p>

Given points A and B in the plane a distance k apart, and any &epsilon; &gt; 0, we can find a point C such that AC and BC are rational and |AC - k| &lt; &epsilon;/2, |BC| &lt; &epsilon;/2. Let A' = f(A), B' = f(B), C' = f(C). Then |A'C'| = |AC|, |B'C'| = |BC|, and hence |A'B'| lies within &epsilon; of k. This is true for all &epsilon; &gt; 0, so |A'B'| = k and f preserves all distances.
