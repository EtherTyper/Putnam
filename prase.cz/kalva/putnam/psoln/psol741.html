<b>Problem A1</b><br>

<p>

S is a subset of {1, 2, 3, ... , 16} which does not contain three integers which are relatively prime in pairs. How many elements can S have?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: 11

<p>

{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 3, 9, 15} has 11 elements. Any three integers from it include two which are multiples of 2 or two which are multiples of 3, so it does not contain three integers which are relatively prime in pairs.

<p>

On the other hand, any subset of 12 elements must include at least 3 members of {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13} and those 3 will be relatively prime in pairs.
