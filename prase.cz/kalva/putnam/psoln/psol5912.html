<b>Problem B5</b><br>

<p>

L<sub>1</sub> is the line { (t + 1, 2t - 4, -3t + 5) <b>:</b> t real } and L<sub>2</sub> is the line { (4t - 12, -t + 8, t + 17) <b>:</b> t real }. Find the smallest sphere touching L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

The sphere has diameter PQ, where P(s + 1, 2s - 4, -3s + 5) is on L<sub>1</sub>, and Q(4t - 12, -t + 8, t + 17) is on L<sub>2</sub>. PQ is as short as possible. It can also be characterised as perpendicular to L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>.

<p>

PQ<sup>2</sup>/2 = 7s<sup>2</sup> + st + 9t<sup>2</sup> + 25s - 52t + 457/2. At the minimum the two partial derivatives must be zero, so  14s + t + 25 = 0, s + 18t - 52 = 0. Solving s = -2, t = 3. This gives P (-3, -12, 11), Q(0, 5, 20), the radius (= PQ/2) as 1/2 &radic;251 and the centre as (-3/2, -7/2, 31/2).

<p>

<i>As originally set, there was a typo, so that the y-coordinate in L<sub>1</sub> appeared as 2t + 4 instead of 2t - 4. That did not change the principle, but made the arithmetic horrendous!</i>
