<b>Problem B3</b><br>

<p>

a<sub>i j</sub> is a positive integer for i, j = 1, 2, 3, ... and for each positive integer we can find exactly eight a<sub>i j</sub> equal to it. Prove that a<sub>i j</sub> &gt; ij for some i, j.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

The idea is to show that for some N there are more than 8N pairs (i, j) with ij &le; N. For then if we always had a<sub>i j</sub> &le; ij we would have a<sub>i j</sub> &le; N for more than 8N pairs (i, j) and hence some value in {1, 2, ... , N} would be shared by more than 8 a<sub>i j</sub>, contradicting the premise.

<p>

The number of pairs (i, j) with ij &le; N is [N/1] + [N/2] + ... + [N/N] = N(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/N) - N. But &sum; 1/n diverges, so it is certainly greater than 9 for N sufficiently large.
