<b>Problem B2</b><br>

<p>

For which real &alpha; does the curve y = x<sup>4</sup> + 9x<sup>3</sup> + &alpha; x<sup>2</sup> + 9x + 4 contain four collinear points?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: &alpha; &lt; 30.375.

<p>

<i>Straightforward.</i>

<p>

We look at the second derivative y'' = 12x<sup>2</sup> + 54x + 2&alpha; = 12(x + 2.25)<sup>2</sup> + 2(&alpha; - 30.375). This has two zeros iff &alpha; &lt; 30.375.

<p>
If &alpha; &gt; 30.375, then y'' has no zeros and hence y' is strictly monotonically increasing. Hence no line cuts the curve in more than two points (if a line gradient k cut the curve at x = a, b and c, with a &lt; b &lt; c, then there would be a point between a and b with gradient k and another between b and c, contradicting the strict monotonicity of y'.].

<p>
If &alpha; &lt; 30.375, the y'' has two zeros either side of x = 2.25. Hence the curve has two points of inflection either side of x = 2.25. The line through these two inflection points will cut the curve in four points. [Suppose the two points are at x = a and x = b with a &lt; b. The line has a smaller gradient than the tangent at the point of inflection at x = a and hence cuts the curve again for x &lt; a. Similarly it has larger gradient than the tangent at the point of inflection at x = b and hence cuts the curve again for x &gt; b.]

<p>
It remains to consider the case &alpha; = 30.375. In this case y'' has a single zero at x = 2.25. In this case there is no point of inflection. The gradient is monotonic and hence a line can only cut the curve in two points. [We cannot have degeneracy with infinitely many solutions because we are dealing with a polynomial which has at most 4 solutions.]
