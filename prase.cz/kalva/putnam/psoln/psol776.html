<b>Problem A6</b><br>

<p>

R is the reals. X is the square [0, 1] x [0, 1]. f <b>:</b> X &rarr; R is continuous. If &int;<sub>Y</sub> f(x, y) dx dy = 0 for all squares Y such that (1) Y &sube; X, (2) Y has sides parallel to those of X, (3) at least one of Y's sides is contained in the boundary of X, is it true that f(x, y) = 0 for all x, y?

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: yes.

<p>

Given any square Z inside X with sides parallel to X, we can find squares Y<sub>1</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub> satisfying the conditions in the question such that Z = Y<sub>1</sub> &cap; Y<sub>2</sub>. Hence &int;<sub>Z</sub> f(x, y) dx dy = 0 for all Z. 

<p>

If f(x, y) &gt; 0 for any interior point (x, y) of X, then by continuity we can find a square Z such that f(x, y) &gt; 0 on Z. Contradiction. Similarly for f(x, y) &lt; 0 for an interior point of X. Hence f(x, y) = 0 on the interior of X and hence (by continuity) on the whole of X.
