<b>Problem A4</b><br>

<p>

Let p(x) &equiv; x<sup>3</sup> + ax<sup>2</sup> + bx - 1, and q(x) &equiv; x<sup>3</sup> + cx<sup>2</sup> + dx + 1 be polynomials with integer coefficients. Let &alpha; be a root of p(x) = 0. p(x) is irreducible over the rationals. &alpha; + 1 is a root of q(x) = 0. Find an expression for another root of p(x) = 0 in terms of &alpha;, but not involving a, b, c, or d.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: the other roots are -1/(&alpha;+1) and - (&alpha;+1)/&alpha;.

<p>

Let the roots of p(x) be &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;. The polynomial q(x+1) has &alpha; as one of its roots. Suppose it is different from p(x). Then by subtracting we get either a quadratic or a linear equation which also has &alpha; as a root. It cannot be a linear equation, because then &alpha; would be rational and hence p(x) would not be irreducible over the rationals. If it was quadratic, then by multiplying it by a suitable rational factor rx + s and subtracting from p(x) we would get a linear factor ux + v which also had &alpha; as a root. If this factor is zero, then we have reduced p(x) over the rationals (as (rx + s) times the quadratic). If not, then &alpha; is a root of ux + v and hence rational, so that p(x) is still reducible. So we must have that p(x) and q(x+1) are identical. So the three roots of q(x) must be &alpha;+1, &beta;+1, &gamma;+1. Hence we have the relations:

<p>&alpha;&beta;&gamma; = 1, (&alpha;+1)(&beta;+1)(&gamma;+1) = -1 (derived from the constant terms of p(x) and q(x) respectively).

<p>

Hence &alpha;(&beta;+&gamma;)+(&beta;+&gamma;)+&alpha;+1+&beta;&gamma;+&alpha;&beta;&gamma; = -1, so (&beta;+&gamma;)(&alpha;+1) = - (3+&alpha;+1/&alpha;), or &beta;+&gamma; = - (3&alpha;+&alpha;<sup>2</sup>+1) / ( &alpha;(&alpha;+1) ). Hence (&beta;-&gamma;)<sup>2</sup> = (&beta;+&gamma;)<sup>2</sup> - 4&beta;&gamma; = (&alpha;<sup>4</sup>+2&alpha;<sup>3</sup>+3&alpha;<sup>2</sup>+2&alpha;+1)/ ( &alpha;<sup>2</sup>(&alpha;+1)<sup>2</sup> ). So &beta;-&gamma; = &plusmn; (&alpha;<sup>2</sup>+&alpha;+1)/ ( &alpha;(&alpha;+1) ) and hence &beta; = -1/(&alpha;+1) or - (&alpha;+1)/&alpha;.
