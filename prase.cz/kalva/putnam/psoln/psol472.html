<b>Problem A2</b><br>

<p>

R is the reals. f <b>:</b> R &rarr; R is continuous and satisfies f(r) = f(x) f(y) for all x, y, where r = &radic;(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>). Show that f(x) = f(1) to the power of x<sup>2</sup>.

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Induction on n shows that f(x &radic;n) = f(x)<sup>n</sup>, and hence f(n x) = f(x) to the power of n<sup>2</sup>. In particular, taking x = 1/n, f(1) = f(1/n) to the power of n<sup>2</sup>. Hence, provided f(1) is non-zero, f(1/n) = f(1) to the power of 1/n<sup>2</sup>. Hence f(m/n) = f(1) to the power of (m/n)<sup>2</sup>. So we have established that f(x) = f(1) to the power of x<sup>2</sup> for all rational x. But f is continuous, so the relation holds for all x. 

<p>

If f(1) = 0, then the same reasoning establishes that f(x) = 0 for all x.
