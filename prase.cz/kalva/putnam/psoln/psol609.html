<b>Problem B2</b><br>

<p>

Let f(m, n) = 3m+n+(m+n)<sup>2</sup>. Find &sum;<sub>0</sub><sup>&infin;</sup>&sum;<sub>0</sub><sup>&infin;</sup> 2<sup>-f(m, n)</sup>.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: 4/3.

<p>

The obvious approach is to sum over n and then over m (or vice versa). But it is not obvious how to sum x<sup>N</sup> where N runs through the squares. So we wonder just what values f(m, n) can take. A little experimentation suggests that it takes each even value just once.

<p>

In fact, it is clear that r(r+1) is always even and that the difference between r(r+1) and the next number in the sequence, (r+1)(r+2) is 2r+2, so any positive even number can be uniquely expressed as r(r+1) + 2s with 0 &le; s &le; r. But taking m = s, n = r-s, this is equivalent to the statement that any positive even number can be uniquely expressed as 3m+n+(m+n)<sup>2</sup>.

<p>

Hence the sum is just 1 + 1/4 + 1/4<sup>2</sup> + ... = 4/3.
