<b>Problem A1</b><br>

<p>

Given two rays OA and OB and a point P between them. Which point X on the ray OA has the property that if XP is extended to meet  the ray OB at Y, then XP&middot;PY has the smallest possible value.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: take OX = OY.

<p>

Let M be the foot of the perpendicular from P to OA, and N be the foot of the perpendicular from P to OB. Obviously X must lie further from O than M - otherwise moving it closer to M would reduce both PX and PY. Similarly Y must lie further from O than N. Let &phi; be the angle MPX and let &theta; be the angle MON. Then the angle NPY is &theta;-&phi;. Hence PX&middot;PY = PM&middot;PN/(cos &phi; cos &theta;-&phi;). So we minimise PX.PY by maximising (cos &phi; cos &theta;-&phi;). But (cos &phi; cos &theta;-&phi;) = 1/2 (cos(&phi;+&theta;-&phi;) + cos(2&phi;-&theta;) ) = 1/2 cos &theta; + 1/2 cos(2&phi;-&theta;). This is obviously maximised by taking &phi; = &theta;-&phi;. But that corresponds to angle PXM = angle PYN and hence OX = OY.

<p>

Alternatively, PX&middot;PY may remind us of the elementary result that if XX'YY' is cyclic with diagonals XY, X'Y' meeting at P, then PX&middot;PY = PX'&middot;PY'. The problem is to find a suitable circle. With hindsight, it is fairly obvious. Take the circle which touches OA at X and OB at Y. Then any other line through P intersects the circle at X' and Y' before it intersects OA and OB (at X'' and Y'' say). Hence PX'' &gt; PX', PY'' &gt; PY' and PX'&middot;PY' = PX&middot;PY. However, I failed to find the right circle until after I had solved the problem trigonometrically.
