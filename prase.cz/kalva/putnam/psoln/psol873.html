<b>Problem A3</b><br>

<p>

y = f(x) is a real-valued solution (for all real x) of the differential equation y'' - 2y' + y = 2e<sup>x</sup> which is positive for all x. Is f '(x) necessarily positive for all x? y = g(x) is another real valued solution, which satisfies g'(x) &gt; 0 for all real x. Is g(x) necessarily positive for all x?

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

(a) no, (b) yes.

<p>

<i>Easy.</i>

<p>

We know that the general solution of y'' - 2y' + y = 0 is A e<sup>x</sup> + B x e<sup>x</sup>. So the particular solution to y'' - 2y' + y = 2e<sup>x</sup> must be of the form C x<sup>2</sup> e<sup>x</sup>, and, indeed, differentiating, we find C = 1. So the general solution is f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> e<sup>x</sup> + A e<sup>x</sup> + B x e<sup>x</sup>. That is all pure book work.

<p>

It is now convenient to rewrite this in a slightly different form: f(x) = ( (x + a)<sup>2</sup> + b ) e<sup>x</sup>, where a and b are still arbitary constants. Then f '(x) = ( (x + a + 1)<sup>2</sup> + b - 1) e<sup>x</sup>. The answers are now obvious. f(x) is always positive iff b &gt; 0, and f '(x) is always positive iff b &gt; 1. So the answer to (a) is No, and the answer to (b) is Yes.
