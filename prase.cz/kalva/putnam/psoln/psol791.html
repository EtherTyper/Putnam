<b>Problem A1</b><br>

<p>

Find the set of positive integers with sum 1979 and maximum possible product.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

<i>Easy</i>

<p>

For n &gt; 4, 2(n - 2) &gt; n, so the maximum product cannot include any integer greater than 4. Also, 2<sup>3</sup> &lt; 3<sup>2</sup>, so it cannot include more than two 2s. Since 4 = 2&middot;2, it cannot include both a 2 and a 4. It obviously does not include a 1, since n + 1 &gt; n x 1. So the maximum product must be made up mainly of 3s, with either no, one or two 2s (or equivalently one 4). Hence for 1979 = 2 + 659&middot;3, the maximum product is 3<sup>659</sup>2.
