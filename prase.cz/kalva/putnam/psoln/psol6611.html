<b>Problem B5</b><br>

<p>

Given n points in the plane, no three collinear, prove that we can label them P<sub>i</sub> so that P<sub>1</sub>P<sub>2</sub>P<sub>3</sub> ... P<sub>n</sub> is a simple closed polygon (with no edge intersecting any other edge except at its endpoints).

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Take arbitrary x, y axes. Take P to be the point with the smallest x-coordinate, or if there are two such, the one with the smaller y-coordinate. Take Q to be the point with the largest x-coordinate, or if there are two such the one with the smaller y-coordinate. Join P to Q by a path p along the lower part of the convex hull of the points (so that all other points are above the path).

<p>

Now order the remaining points not in the path according to the size of their x-coordinate (with the largest first). Continue the path from Q back to P by taking the remaining points in this order. We can never intersect the existing path p without going outside the convex hull and we cannot intersect the later part of the path because it has smaller x-coordinate.

<p>

<i>Comment. It is tempting to argue by induction. Take a path through the first n. Then given another point P, we can always find two earlier points Q and R, so that PQ and PR do not intersect the n-path. Then replace the segment QR by QP and PR. Unfortunately, this is false. It is not too hard to find cases where we cannot find such Q, R. </i>
