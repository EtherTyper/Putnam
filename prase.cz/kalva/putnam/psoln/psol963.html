<b>Problem A3</b><br>

<p>

There are six courses on offer. Each of 20 students chooses some all or none of the courses. Is it true that we can find two courses C and C' and five students S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>3</sub>, S<sub>4</sub>, S<sub>5</sub> such that each S<sub>i</sub> has chosen C and C', or such that each S<sub>i</sub> has chosen neither C nor C'?

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: false.

<p><i>Easy, once you have seen it!</i>

<p>
A little experimentation suggests that if the result is false the choice of courses taken and not taken must be fairly balanced. This suggests taking the set S of all distinct subsets of 3 courses. |S| = 20, so we allocate one member of S to each student. Now there are 4 members of S containing any two given courses and 4 members of S not containing either of two given courses, so the assertion in the question is false.
