<b>Problem A5</b><br>

<p>

Given a parabola, construct the focus (with ruler and compass).

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

<i>Hard. Well, unless you know a lot about the geometry of the parabola.</i>

<p>

You need to know two facts:

<br>(1) Rays from infinity come to a focus at the focus. In other words, if a line L parallel to the axis of the parabola meets it at X and the focus is F, then L and XF are equally inclined to the normal at X;

<br>(2) The line joining the midpoints of two parallel chords is parallel to the axis.

<p>The construction is then fairly obvious. Take two parallel chords. Join their midpoints and extend to meet the parabola at X. Take a line M through X parallel to the chords. Then M is a tangent. The line perpendicular to M through X is the normal. Hence find the line XF (although not yet F). Repeat for another pair of parallel chords. The two lines interesect at F.
