<b>Problem A2</b><br>

<p>

Find f(m, n), the number of 4-tuples (a, b, c, d) of positive integers such that the lowest common multiple of any three integers in the 4-tuple is 3<sup>m</sup>7<sup>n</sup>.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: (6m<sup>2</sup> + 3m + 1)(6n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1).

<p>

Each of a, b, c, d must be of the form 3<sup>h</sup>7<sup>k</sup> with h &le; m, k &le; n. We can consider h and k separately. At least two of a, b, c, d must have h = m. So there are three cases: (1) all of a, b, c, d have h = m (1 possibility); (2) three of a, b, c, d have h = m and the other has 0 &le; h &lt; m (3m possibilities); (3) two of a, b, c, d have h = m and the other two have 0 &le; h &lt; m (6m<sup>2</sup> possibilities). So, in all, there are 6m<sup>2</sup> + 3m + 1 possibilities for h. Similarly, there are 6n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1 possibilities for k. Each of the possibilities for h can be combined with each of the possibilities for k, so in all there are (6m<sup>2</sup> + 3m + 1)(6n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1) possible 4-tuples.
