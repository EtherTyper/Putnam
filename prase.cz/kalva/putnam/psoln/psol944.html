<b>Problem A4</b><br>

<p>

A and B are 2 x 2 matrices with integral values. A, A + B, A + 2B, A + 3B, and A + 4B all have inverses with integral values. Show that A + 5B does also.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let A = (a<sub>ij</sub>), B = (b<sub>ij</sub>). Given any matrix C = (c<sub>ij</sub>), C is invertible iff the determinant d = c<sub>11</sub>c<sub>22</sub> - c<sub>12</sub>c<sub>21</sub> is non-zero and the inverse is then (d<sub>ij</sub>) where d<sub>11</sub> = c<sub>22</sub>/d, d<sub>12</sub> = -c<sub>12</sub>/d, d<sub>21</sub> = -c<sub>21</sub>/d, d<sub>22</sub> = c<sub>11</sub>/d. Thus if the inverse has integer entries, then d divides all the entries in the original matrix and hence d<sup>2</sup> divides d, so d = 1 or -1.

<p>
Multiplying out, we find that det(A + nB) = a + nh + n<sup>2</sup>k, where a = det A = 1 or -1, h = (a<sub>11</sub>b<sub>22</sub> - a<sub>12</sub>b<sub>21</sub> - a<sub>21</sub>b<sub>12</sub> + a<sub>22</sub>b<sub>11</sub>), and k = det B. Since A + B has integral entries, a + h + k = 1 or -1 (1). Similarly, A + 2B has integral entries, so a + 2h + 4k = 1 or -1 (2). We find that the only solutions to (1) and (2) are a, h, k = 1,0,0; 1,1,-1; 1,-3,1; 1,-4,2; -1,0,0; -1,-1,1; -1,3,-1; -1,4,-2 (*).

<p>
But A + 3B also has integral entries, so in the same way we conclude that a + 3h + 9k = 1 or -1 and hence h + 5k = 0, 2, or -2 (3). The only solutions (*) which also satisfy (3) are 1,0,0 and -1,0,0. Hence det(A + nB) = det A for all n, and so A + nB is invertible and has integer entries for all integers n. 

<p>
Note that we do not need to use A + 4B. Note also that the fact of integer entries is essential. It is easy to find counter-examples with non-integer entries, eg take a<sub>11</sub> = 4, a<sub>12</sub> = a<sub>21</sub> = 0, a<sub>22</sub> = 1, and b<sub>11</sub> = -1, b<sub>12</sub> = b<sub>21</sub> = b<sub>22</sub> = 0.

<p>On reflection, the reason for including A + 4B was probably to allow the following simpler solution: a + hn + kn<sup>2</sup> takes the values 1 or -1 for the 5 values n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Hence it must take one value at least 3 times. But that is impossible for a quadratic unless it is constant. Hence it is constant. Then as before.
