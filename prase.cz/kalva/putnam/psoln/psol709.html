<b>Problem B3</b><br>

<p>

S is a closed subset of the real plane. Its projection onto the x-axis is bounded. Show that its projection onto the y-axis is closed.

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let Y be the projection onto the y-axis and X the projection on the x-axis. Let { y<sub>n</sub>} be any Cauchy sequence in Y. Then { y<sub>n</sub> } must converge to some real y. We have to show that y is in Y. For each n take any x<sub>n</sub> such that (x<sub>n</sub>, y<sub>n</sub>) is in S. Then { x<sub>n</sub>  } lies in X, which is bounded, so { x<sub>n</sub> } is bounded. But any bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence. So we can take a subsequence { u<sub>n</sub> } of { x<sub>n</sub> } which is convergent and therefore Cauchy. Let { v<sub>n</sub> } be the corresponding subsequence of { y <sub>n</sub> }. Then { v<sub>n</sub> } is also Cauchy and hence the sequence of points P<sub>n</sub> = (u<sub>n</sub>, v<sub>n</sub>) in S is Cauchy. But S is closed so P converges to some (u, v) in S. Hence { v<sub>n</sub> } converges to v, which is in Y (it is the projection of (u, v) ). But since { y<sub>n</sub> } converges to y, its subsequence { v<sub>n</sub> } must also converge to y. Hence y = v and y is in Y.
