<b>Problem A6</b>

<p>

Is it possible to partition {0, 1, 2, 3, ... } into two parts such that n = x + y with x &ne; y has the same number of solutions in each part?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>
<b>Answer</b>

<p>

Yes.
<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

Put A = numbers with an odd number of binary digits, B = numbers with an even number of binary digits. Let S be the set of pairs (a,b) with a &ne; b and a, b non-negative. Define f: S &rarr; S as follows. Given (a,b) &isin; S take the first digit from the right which differs in a and b and switch it in both to give (a',b'). Evidently (a',b') &isin; S and a + b = a' + b'. Also f is its own inverse. Note that (a,b) is a pair of numbers from A iff f(a,b) is a pair of numbers from B. Thus f gives a bijection between solutions of n = x + y in A and solutions in B.
