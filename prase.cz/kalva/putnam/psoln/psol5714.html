<b>Problem B7</b><br>

<p>

Let P be a regular polygon and its interior. Show that for any n &gt; 1, we can find a subset S<sub>n</sub> of the plane such that we cannot translate and rotate P to cover S<sub>n</sub> but we can translate and rotate P to cover any n points of S<sub>n</sub>.

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let the radius of the inscribed circle in P be 1. Let P have m sides. We take S<sub>n</sub> to be a circle of radius slightly greater than 1. Clearly it cannot fit inside P. Place it so that its centre is at the centre of P. Suppose it cuts each side a distance tan<sup>-1</sup>&theta; either side of the midpoint, where &theta; is small. Then the arcs lying outside P subtend a total angle 2m&theta; at the centre. Now rotate the circle about its centre. Let &phi; measure the angle of rotation from the starting point. In order to keep a given point of the circle inside P, &phi; must avoid intervals  of total length 2m&theta;. So to keep any given n points of the circle inside P, &phi; must avoid intervals of total length 2mn&theta;. The worst case is that these intervals are all disjoint, but provided &theta; &lt; &pi;/mn they cannot exhaust the available 2&pi;, so we can find angles &phi; for which all n points are inside P.
