<b>Problem A3</b><br>

<p>

A particle moves in the Euclidean plane. At time t (taking all real values) its coordinates are x = t<sup>3</sup> - t and y = t<sup>4</sup> + t. Show that its velocity has a maximum at t = 0, and that its path has an inflection at t = 0.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

The speed squared is (dx/dt)<sup>2</sup> + (dy/dt)<sup>2</sup> = 16t<sup>6</sup> + 9t<sup>4</sup> + 8t<sup>3</sup> - 6t<sup>2</sup> + 2. Let this be f(t). We have f '(t) = 12t(8t<sup>4</sup> + 3t<sup>2</sup> + 2t - 1). So f '(t) = 0 at t = 0. Also for t small (positive or negative), 8t<sup>4</sup> + 3t<sup>2</sup> + 2t - 1 is close to -1 and hence negative, so f '(t) is positive for t just less than 0 and negative for t just greater than 0. Hence f(t) has a maximum at t = 0. Hence the speed does also.

<p>

The gradient dy/dx = (4t<sup>3</sup> + 1)/(3t<sup>2</sup> - 1). Let this be g(t). Then g'(t) = 6t(2t<sup>3</sup> - 2t - 1)/(3t<sup>2</sup> - 1)<sup>2</sup>. Hence g'(0) = 0. Also g'(t) is positive for t just less than 0 and negative for t just greater than 0, so it is a point of inflection.

<p>

<i>Comment. This seems to be an entirely routine exercise in differentiation.</i>
