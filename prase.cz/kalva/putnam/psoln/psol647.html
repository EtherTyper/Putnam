<b>Problem B1</b><br>

<p>

a<sub>n</sub> are positive integers such that &sum; 1/a<sub>n</sub> converges. b<sub>n</sub> is the number of a<sub>n</sub> which are &lt;= n. Prove lim b<sub>n</sub>/n = 0.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

If not, then for some k &gt; 0 we can find arbitrarily large N such that b<sub>N</sub> &gt; kN. Then at least kN of the integers a<sub>1</sub>, ... , a<sub>N</sub> do not exceed N. Let S be the set of indices i from 1, 2, ... N with a<sub>i</sub> &le; N. Then since S has at least kN members, the sum over S of 1/a<sub>i</sub> is at least k. 

<p>

The idea is to take N' &gt; N with b<sub>N'</sub> &gt; kN' and to ensure that half the indices i with a<sub>i</sub> &le; N' were not included in S. Take S' to be these new indices. Then since S' does not overlap S, the sum over S and S' of 1/a<sub>i</sub> is at least k + k/2. We then repeat always choosing the new set of indices not to overlap any of the previous sets. So at each stage we will add k/2 to the sum of 1/a<sub>i</sub>, which must therefore diverge, establishing a contradiction.

<p>

We can do this by taking the successor N' to N sufficiently big. In fact, it is sufficient to take N'/2 &gt; N/k because we know that all of the previous index sets are contained in {1, 2, ... , N}, so to avoid them we do not have to drop more than N &lt; kN'/2 indices, leaving at least kN'/2 new indices.
