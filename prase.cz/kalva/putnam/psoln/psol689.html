<b>Problem B3</b><br>

<p>

Given that a 60<sup>o</sup> angle cannot be trisected with ruler and compass, prove that a 120<sup>o</sup>/n angle cannot be trisected with ruler and compass for n = 1, 2, 3, ... .

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

This is a trap.

<p>

The obvious answer is that if we could trisect an angle 120<sup>o</sup>/n, that would give us an angle 40<sup>o</sup>/n and hence 60<sup>o</sup>/3. But we are told we cannot trisect 60<sup>o</sup>.

<p>

This does not work for a slightly subtle reason. We are given the angle 120<sup>o</sup>/n. That <b><i>in itself</i></b> may help us to trisect 60<sup>o</sup>. For example, it certainly allows us to trisect 60<sup>o</sup> if n = 6. 

<p>

So we have to use the standard Galois theory approach. It is not hard to show that a straight-edge allows us to get rational distances and compasses allow us to get any finite number of square roots. So we can construct distances which are in an extension K of the rationals of degree 2<sup>n</sup> for some n. Constructing an angle is equivalent to constructing its cosine. 

<p>

So if we are given an angle A, then we can construct distances which are in any extension K of degree 2<sup>n</sup>over Q(cos A). Now if K is an extension of L of degree r and L is an extension of F of degree s, then K is an extension of degree rs of F. So suppose Q(cos A) has degree u and Q(cos(A/3 ) has degree v. If we can construct A/3 given A, then cos(A/3) must lie in an extension K of Q(cos A) of degree 2<sup>n</sup>. But K is also an extension of Q(cos(A/3) ) so v/u must be a power of 2.

<p>

Finally, it is well-known that Q(cos(360/m) ) has degree &phi;(m) over Q, where &phi; is Euler's function (so that &phi;(m) is the number of 1, 2, ... m-1 relatively prime to m). So we have to show that &phi;(9n)/&phi;(3n) is not a power of 2. But &phi;(m) = m &prod;(1 - 1/p), where the product is taken over all primes p dividing m. But 3n and 9n have the same prime divisors, so &phi;(9n) = 3 &phi;(3n), and 3 is not a power of 2.
