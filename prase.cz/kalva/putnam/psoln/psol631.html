<b>Problem A1</b><br>

<p>

Dissect a regular 12-gon into a regular hexagon, 6 squares and 6 equilateral triangles. Let the regular 12-gon have vertices P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, ... , P<sub>12</sub> (in that order). Show that the diagonals P<sub>1</sub>P<sub>9</sub>, P<sub>12</sub>P<sub>4</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>P<sub>11</sub> are concurrent.

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Take squares on the inside of alternate sides of the 12-gon. Each angle of the 12-gon is 150<sup>o</sup>, so the remaining angles after placing the squares are all 60<sup>o</sup>, so we have equilateral triangles on the inside of the remaining 6 sides of the 12-gon. Now the opposite sides of the squares form a hexagon. (As a check we may notice that if A, B, C, D are adjacent vertices of the 12-gon and we place squares ABPQ on AB and CDRS on CD, then S and P coincide and the equilateral triangle ABP and the two squares take 60<sup>o</sup> + 90<sup>o</sup> + 90<sup>o</sup> out of the 360<sup>o</sup> angle at P leaving 120<sup>o</sup>, which is the angle between sides of a regular hexagon.)

<p>

Let O be the centre of the 12-gon. P<sub>1</sub>P<sub>9</sub> and P<sub>12</sub>P<sub>4</sub> have the same length and one is obtained from the other by rotation about O through 90<sup>o</sup>. Thus they intersect on the perpendicular bisector of P<sub>12</sub>P<sub>1</sub> a distance P<sub>12</sub>P<sub>1</sub>/2 from P<sub>12</sub>P<sub>1</sub>. P<sub>11</sub>P<sub>2</sub> is parallel to P<sub>12</sub>P<sub>1</sub> and its midpoint lies on the perpendicular bisector of P<sub>12</sub>P<sub>1</sub>. The angle P<sub>11</sub>P<sub>2</sub>P<sub>1</sub> is 180<sup>o</sup> - angle P<sub>12</sub>P<sub>1</sub>P<sub>2</sub> = 30<sup>o</sup>, so the distance between of the midpoint along the bisector is P<sub>12</sub>P<sub>1</sub>sin 30<sup>o</sup> = P<sub>12</sub>P<sub>1</sub>/2. Hence the three lines intersect at this point.
