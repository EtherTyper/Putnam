<b>Problem A5</b><br>

<p>

Let P be a convex polygon. Let Q be the interior of P and S = P &cup; Q. Let p be the perimeter of P and A its area. Given any point (x, y) let d(x, y) be the distance from (x, y) to the nearest point of S. Find constants &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma; such that &int;<sub>U</sub> e<sup>-d(x,y)</sup> dx dy = &alpha; + &beta;p + &gamma;A, where U is the whole plane.

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: A + p + 2&pi;.

<p>

For any point in S we have d(x, y) = 0. Hence the integral over S is just A. The locus of points a distance z from S is a set of segments parallel to the sides of P and displaced a distance z outwards, together with a set of arcs joining them. Each arc is centered on a vertex of P and has radius z. Together the arcs can be translated to form a complete circle radius z. Thus the set of points a distance z to z + &delta;z from S is a strip of area p &delta;z + 2&pi;z &delta;z. Thus the integral outside S is just

<p>

&int;<sub>0</sub><sup>&infin;</sup> exp( - z) (p + 2&pi;z) dz. This evaluates easily to p + 2&pi;.
