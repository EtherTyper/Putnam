<b>Problem B3</b><br>

<p>

Find a continuous function f <b>:</b> [0, 1] &rarr; [0, 1] such that given any &beta; &isin; [0, 1], we can find infinitely many &alpha; such that f(&alpha;) = &beta;.

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

We use an adapted space-filling curve. Let g(x) be a piecewise linear function with period 2: g(x) = 0 on [0, 1/3], 1 on [2/3, 4/3] and 0 on [5/3, 2] with linear connecting pieces. For t any real in the range 0 &le; t &le; 1 let f(t) = g(t)/2 + g(9t)/4 + g(81t)/8 + g(729t)/16 + ... . The series is obviously uniformly convergent, so f is continuous.

<p>

Now suppose that in base 3 we have t = 0.c<sub>1</sub>c<sub>2</sub>c<sub>3</sub> ... with all c<sub>n</sub> = 0 or 2. Then 9<sup>n</sup>t = even integer + 0.c<sub>2n+1</sub>c<sub>2n+2</sub>... . Now 0.c<sub>2n+1</sub>c<sub>2n+2</sub>...  lies in [0, 1/3] if c<sub>2n+1</sub> = 0 and in [2/3, 1] if c<sub>2n+1</sub> = 2, so g(9<sup>n</sup>t) = 0 if c<sub>2n+1</sub> = 0, 1 if c<sub>2n+1</sub> = 2. Thus f(t) has the binary expansion 0.a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>a<sub>3</sub> ... , where a<sub>n</sub> = c<sub>2n-1</sub>/2. So given any s in [0, 1] we can find infinitely many t with f(t) = s, for odd n pick c<sub>n</sub> to give the correct binary expansion and for even n pick c<sub>n</sub> arbitrarily.
