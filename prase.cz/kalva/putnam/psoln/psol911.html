<b>Problem A1</b><br>

<p>

The rectangle with vertices (0, 0), (0, 3), (2, 0) and (2, 3) is rotated clockwise through a right angle about the point (2, 0), then about (5, 0), then about (7, 0), and finally about (10, 0). The net effect is to translate it a distance 10 along the x-axis. The point initially at (1, 1) traces out a curve. Find the area under this curve (in other words, the area of the region bounded by the curve, the x-axis and the lines parallel to the y-axis through (1, 0) and (11, 0) ).

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: 7&pi;/2 + 6.

<p>Trivial - in the great tradition of Putnam problems designed to stop the dunces scoring nil.

<p>Draw a diagram. The required area is comprised of two quarter-disks radius &radic;2, two quarter disks radius &radic;5, four right-angle triangles sides 1, 1, &radic;2, and four right-angle triangles sides 1, 2, &radic;5. Hence area = &pi; + 5/2 &pi; + 2 + 4.
