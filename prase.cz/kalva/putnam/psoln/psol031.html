<b>Problem A1</b>

<p>

Given n, how many ways can we write n as a sum of one or more positive integers a<sub>1</sub> &le; a<sub>2</sub> &le; ... &le; a<sub>k</sub> with a<sub>k</sub> - a<sub>1</sub> = 0 or 1.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Answer</b>

<p>

n
<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

There is one way for each 1 &le; k &le; n. Induction on n. Obvious for n = 1. Write the solution with a &gt; 0 Ns and b &ge; 0 (N+1)s as (a,b,N). Define a map f from the solutions for n to the solutions for n+1 by f(a,b,N) = (a-1,b+1,N) for a &gt; 1 or (b+1,0,N+1) for a = 1. Define a map g from the solutions for n+1 excluding (n,0,1) to the solutions for n by g(a,b,N) = (a+1,b-1,N) for b &ge; 1 and (1,a-1,N-1) for b = 1. Evidently f and g are inverses, so each is a bijection. Hence there is one more solution for n+1 than for n.
