<b>Problem B6</b><br>

<p>

A <i>compact</i> set of real numbers is closed and bounded. Show that we cannot find compact sets A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, ... such that (1) all elements of A<sub>n</sub> are rational and (2) given any compact set K whose members are all rationals, K &sube; some A<sub>n</sub>.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Use a diagonalisation argument.

<p>

Suppose we can find such A<sub>n</sub>. Let S<sub>n</sub> be the interval [1/2<sup>2n</sup>, 1/2<sup>2n-1</sup>], and let T<sub>n</sub> be the set of rational points in S<sub>n</sub>. Then the closure of T<sub>n</sub> is S<sub>n</sub>, which contains irrational points, so there must be points of T<sub>n</sub> which are not in A<sub>n</sub>. Let x<sub>n</sub> be one such. Now consider {x<sub>n</sub>}. Its only limit point is 0, so K, the union of {x<sub>n</sub>} and {0}, is a compact set of rationals. But K is not contained in any of the A<sub>n</sub>, because it has a member x<sub>n</sub> not in A<sub>n</sub> for each n. Contradiction.
