<b>Problem A5</b><br>

<p>

The parabola y = x<sup>2</sup> rolls around the fixed parabola y = -x<sup>2</sup>. Find the locus of its focus (initially at x = 0, y = 1/4).

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: horizontal line y = 1/4.

<p>

The tangent to the fixed parabola at (t, -t<sup>2</sup>) has gradient -2t, so its equation is (y + t<sup>2</sup>) = -2t(x - t). We wish to find the reflection of the focus of the fixed parabola in this line, because that is the locus of the rolling parabola when they touch at (t, -t<sup>2</sup>). The line through the focus of the fixed parabola (0, -1/4) and its mirror image is perpendicular to the tangent and so has gradient 1/(2t). Hence its equation is (y + 1/4) = x/(2t). Hence it intersects the tangent at the point with y + t<sup>2</sup> = -4t<sup>2</sup>(y + 1/4) + 2t<sup>2</sup> or y(1 + 4t<sup>2</sup>) = 0, hence at the point (t/2, 0). So the mirror image is the point (t, 1/4). t can vary from -&infin; to +&infin;, so the locus is the horizontal line through (0, 1/4).
