<b>Problem A4</b><br>

<p>

The plane is divided into 3 disjoint sets. Can we always find two points in the same set a distance 1 apart? What about 9 disjoint sets?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: yes, no.

<p>

<i>Easy.</i>

<p>

Suppose it is impossible. Take a triangle ABC with AB = AC = &radic;3, BC = 1. A and B must be in the same set, because we can take two points X, Y such that AXY and BXY are equilateral triangles with side 1 (and then X and Y use up two sets, so A and B must both be the third set). Similarly A and C must be in the same set. But then B and C are in the same set and a distance 1 apart.

<p>

Tile the plane with squares side 0.7. Take all the points in a tile to be in the same set and label the tile 1 to 9 accordingly. Labels the tiles as follows:

<tt><br>...

<br>...123123123...

<br>...456456456...

<br>...789789789...

<br>...123123123...

<br>...456456456...

<br>...</tt>

<br>

Two points in the same tile are at most a distance 0.7 &radic;2 &lt; 1 apart, and two points in different tiles with the same color are at least a distance 2 x 0.7 = 1.4 &gt; 1 apart.
