<b>Problem B4</b><br>

<p>

For real r &gt; 0, define m(r) =min{ |r - &radic;(m<sup>2</sup>+2n<sup>2</sup>)| for m, n integers}. Prove or disprove: (1) lim<sub>r&rarr;&infin;</sub> m(r) exists; and (2) is zero.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: true, true.

<p>

<i>Fairly easy.</i>

<p>

Two heuristic arguments. First, if we think of lattice points at (m, n/&radic;2), it seems likely that large circles will pass increasingly close to lattice points. So the results look true. 

<p>

Second, let x<sub>m,n</sub> = &radic;(m<sup>2</sup>+2n<sup>2</sup>), and let us confine our attention to the values x<sub>m,n</sub> lying between m and m + 1. There are about &radic;m of them in a distance 1 and roughly equally spaced, so any real number between m and m+1 should lie within about 1/&radic;m of one of them.

<p>

In making this rigorous, the important thing is to keep it simple. We do not need a good approximation, just an adequate one. Observe first that &radic;(1 + x) &lt; 1 + x/2, so &radic;(a + x) - &radic;a &lt; x/(2 &radic;a). So given any r &gt; 0, take r &isin; (m, m+1], and the largest n st m<sup>2</sup> + 2n<sup>2</sup> &lt; r<sup>2</sup>, so that r &isin; ( &radic;(m<sup>2</sup> + 2n<sup>2</sup>), &radic;(m<sup>2</sup> + 2(n+1)<sup>2</sup>) ]. The distance of r from the nearest lattice point is certainly less than the width of this interval, d. Also 2n<sup>2</sup> &lt; 2m + 1 &lt; 8m, so n &lt; 2&radic;m. So, using our earlier observation, d &lt; (2n + 1)/&radic;(m<sup>2</sup> + 2n<sup>2</sup>) &lt; (2n + 1)/m &lt; (4&radic;m + 1)/m which tends to zero as r &rarr; &infin;.
