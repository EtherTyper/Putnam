<b>Problem B5</b><br>

<p>

Let F be the field with p elements. Let S be the set of 2 x 2 matrices over F with trace 1 and determinant 0. Find |S|.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: p<sup>2</sup> + p.

<p>

Let the matrix be

<pre>

 a  b

 c  d

</pre>

If we take any a not 0 or 1, then d is fixed as 1 - a and is also not 0. Hence bc is fixed as a(1 - a) and is non-zero. So we can take any b not 0 and d is then fixed. Altogether that gives us (p - 2)(p - 1) possibilities.

<p>

If we take a as 0 or 1, the d is fixed as 1 - a and bc must be 0. That gives 2p-1 possibilities for bc, or 4p-2 possibilities in all.

<p>

So in total we have (p - 2)(p - 1) + 4p - 2 = p<sup>2</sup> + p.
