<b>Problem A2</b><br>

<p>

Given any 5 distinct points on the surface of a sphere, show that we can find a closed hemisphere which contains at least 4 of them.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Pigeonhole principle.

<p>

Take a great circle through two of the points. Then at least two of the other three points must lie in one of the hemispheres bounded by the great circle.
