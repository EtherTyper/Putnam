<b>Problem B3</b><br>

<p>

Prove that infinitely many positive integers n have the property that for any prime p dividing n<sup>2</sup> + 3, we can find an integer m such that (1) p divides m<sup>2</sup> + 3, and (2) m<sup>2</sup> &lt; n.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

I started by finding some small n with the required property. This led to: (1) 5<sup>2</sup> + 3 = 2<sup>2</sup>7, with 7 | 2<sup>2</sup> + 3, 2 | 1<sup>2</sup> + 3; (2) 12<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 7<sup>2</sup>3, with 3 | 3<sup>2</sup> + 3; (3) 23<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 2<sup>2</sup>7 19 with 19<sup>2</sup> | 4<sup>2</sup> + 3.

<p>

That suggested as the first line of attack looking at special n such as 2<sup>a</sup>7<sup>b</sup>. That led nowhere.

<p>

My second line of attack was to look for relations of the type (a<sup>2</sup> + 3)(b<sup>2</sup> + 3) = f(a, b)<sup>2</sup> + 3. After some playing around, I obtained (m<sup>2</sup> + 3)( (m+1)<sup>2</sup> + 3) = M<sup>2</sup> + 3, where M = (m<sup>2</sup> + m + 3). We are almost there. Any prime factor of M<sup>2</sup> + 3 which divides m<sup>2</sup> + 3 has the required property since m<sup>2</sup> &lt; M. But that is not true for prime factors of (m+1)<sup>2</sup> + 3. However, all we have to do is to iterate. We need to split the larger factor:

<p>

(m<sup>2</sup> + 3)( (m+1)<sup>2</sup> + 3)( (m<sup>2</sup>+m+2)<sup>2</sup> + 3) = ( (m<sup>2</sup>+m+2)<sup>2</sup> + (m<sup>2</sup>+m+2) + 3)<sup>2</sup> + 3.

<p>

This shows that any n of the form ( (m<sup>2</sup>+m+2)<sup>2</sup> + (m<sup>2</sup>+m+2) + 3) has the required property.
