<b>Problem A6</b><br>

<p>

Given n reals &alpha;<sub>i</sub> &isin; [0, 1] show that we can find &beta; &isin; [0, 1] such that &sum; 1/|&beta; - &alpha;<sub>i</sub>| &le; 8n &sum;<sub>1</sub><sup>n</sup> 1/(2i - 1).

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

The trick is to pick several candidates &beta;<sub>j</sub> and then to take &sum;<sub>j</sub>1/|&beta;<sub>j</sub> - &alpha;<sub>i</sub>|.

<p>

Divide [0, 1] into 2n equal intervals, each width 1/2n. Then at least n of them do not contain any &alpha;<sub>i</sub>. Take the &beta;<sub>j</sub> to be the midpoints of n empty subintervals. Then certainly |&beta;<sub>j</sub> - &alpha;<sub>i</sub>| &ge; 1/4n. If we fix j, then we cannot say more than that, so we get &sum;<sub>i</sub> 1/|&beta;<sub>j</sub> - &alpha;<sub>i</sub>| &le; n 4n, which is not good enough.

<p>

But if we fix i, then we can say more: at most two &beta;<sub>j</sub> can be at the minimum distance 1/4n, at most two more at 3/4n, at most two more at 5/4n and so on. We now sum over j. We do not know whether there are one or two &beta;<sub>j</sub> at each stage (because if &alpha;<sub>i</sub> is off-center, then fairly soon we run into the endpoint going one way, and so start getting just one &beta;<sub>j</sub>). But it is certainly conservative to assume that we have two at each stage and go on for n pairs. So summing over j gives: &sum;<sub>j</sub> 1/|&beta;<sub>j</sub> - &alpha;<sub>i</sub>| &lt; 8n &sum; 1/(2i - 1). Now summing over all a<sub>i</sub> multiplies the result by n. At least one b<sub>j</sub> must give a result that is not above average, so we can find &beta; with the sum at most 8n &sum; 1/(2i - 1).
