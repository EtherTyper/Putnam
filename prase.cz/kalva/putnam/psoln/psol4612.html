<b>Problem B6</b><br>

<p>

The particle P moves in the plane. At t = 0 it starts from the point A with velocity zero. It is next at rest at t = T, when its position is the point B. Its path from A to B is the arc of a circle center O. Prove that its acceleration at each point in the time interval [0, T] is non-zero, and that at some point in the interval its acceleration is directly towards the center O.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

This is almost trivial. Take polar coordinates with origin O. Let the radius of the circular arc be k. The particle's radial acceleration is k (d&theta;/dt)<sup>2</sup> towards O. Its tangential acceleration is k d<sup>2</sup>&theta;/dt<sup>2</sup>. Since the particle is not at rest between A and B, (d&theta;/dt) is non-zero, so the radial acceleration is non-zero (and hence its total acceleration).

<p>

(d&theta;/dt) is zero at A and at B, so its derivative (and hence the tangential acceleration) must be zero at some point between.
