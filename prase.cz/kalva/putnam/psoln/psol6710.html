<b>Problem B4</b><br>

<p>

We are given a sequence a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ... , a<sub>n</sub>. Each a<sub>i</sub> can take the values 0 or 1. Initially, all a<sub>i</sub> = 0. We now successively carry out steps 1, 2, ... , n. At step m we change the value of a<sub>i</sub> for those i which are a multiple of m. Show that after step n, a<sub>i</sub> = 1 iff i is a square. Devise a similar scheme give a<sub>i</sub> = 1 iff i is twice a square.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

a<sub>i</sub> is changed once for each divisor of i. If i is non-square then it has an even number of divisors (they come in pairs d, i/d), so a<sub>i</sub> ends as 0. If i is square it has an odd number of divisors and so a<sub>i</sub> ends as 1.

<p>

We change those that a multiple of 2, then those that are a multiple of 4, then those that are a multiple of 6 and so on. This only affects the even numbers and indeed a<sub>2i</sub> is changed once for each divisor of i, so the same argument as before shows that a<sub>2i</sub> ends as 1 iff i is a square. Note that a<sub>2i+1</sub> is never changed, so it remains 0.
