<b>Problem B3</b><br>

<p>

A, B, C, D lie in a plane. No three are collinear and the four points do not lie on a circle. Show that one point lies inside the circle through the other three.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

If the convex hull is a triangle, then the fourth point lies inside its circumcircle. So suppose ABCD is convex. One pair of opposite angles must have sum greater than 180<sup>o</sup> (otherwise the points would lie on a circle). Suppose they are A and C. Then we claim that C lies inside the circle through A, B, D. Take a point C' on the ray DC on the far side of C from D such that &ang;CBC' = &ang;A + &ang;C - 180<sup>o</sup>. Then &ang;C' = 180<sup>o</sup> - &ang;A. So C' lies on the circle. Hence C which lies on the segment C'D lies inside the circle.
