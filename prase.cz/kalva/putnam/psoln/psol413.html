<b>Problem A3</b><br>

<p>

A circle radius a rolls in the plane along the x-axis the envelope of a diameter is the curve C. Show that we can find a point on the circumference of a circle radius a/2, also rolling along the x-axis, which traces out the curve C.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Consider a circle radius a/2 with center initially at (0,a/2) rolling along the x-axis. After rolling through an angle &theta;, the point initially at (0,a) is at a/2 sin &theta;, a/2 cos &theta; relative to the center and hence at P (a&theta;/2 + (a/2) sin &theta;, a/2 + (a/2) cos &theta;). The tangent at P is (y - (a/2)(1 + cos &theta;)/(x - (a/2)(&theta; + sin &theta;) = (-sin &theta;)/(1 + cos &theta;), or x sin &theta; + y(1 - cos &theta;) = (a/2)(&theta; sin &theta; + 2 cos &theta; + 2). 
<p>
If we put &theta; = 2&phi;, then sin &theta; = 2 sin &phi; cos &phi;, 1 + cos &theta; = 2 cos<sup>2</sup>&phi;, so the tangent at P has equation, x sin &phi; + y cos &phi; = a(&phi; sin &phi; + cos &phi;).
<p>
Now consider the circle radius a with center initially at (0,a). When it has rolled through an angle &phi;, its center is at (a&phi;, a), so the diameter which is initially horizontal lies on the line (y-a)/(x-a&phi;) = -tan &phi;, or x sin &phi; + y cos &phi; = a(&phi; sin &phi; + cos &phi;). In other words, the diameter is tangent to the point P of the curve traced out by the point on the circumference of the circle radius a/2. Hence the envelope of the diameter is that curve.
<p>
<i>A rather more sophisticated solution by Dave Rusin is as follows</i>
<p>
Consider the large circle. When the center is at (a&phi;, a), a point initially at (u,a) has rotated to (u cos &phi;, -u sin &phi;) relative to the center and hence is at the point f(&phi;,u) = (a&phi; + u cos &phi;, a - u sin &phi;). The envelope can be computed as the singular points of f. In matrix form the derivative is
<pre>a - u sin &phi;    cos &phi;
  - u cos &phi;   - sin &phi;
</pre>
Its determinant is zero when u = a sin &phi;. The image of such a point is (x,y) = f(&phi;,u) = (a&phi; + a sin &phi; cos &phi;, a - a sin &phi; sin &phi;) = (a/2)(2&phi; + sin 2&phi;, 1 + cos 2&phi;). As noted above, this is also the position of a point on the circumference of a circle radius a/2 rolling along the x-axis.
