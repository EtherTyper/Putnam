<b>Problem B6</b><br>

<p>

What is the shortest distance between the plane Ax + By + Cz + 1 = 0 and the ellipsoid x<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup> = 1. You may find it convenient to use the notation h = (A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup> + C<sup>2</sup>)<sup>-1/2</sup>, m = (a<sup>2</sup>A<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>B<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>C<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>. What is the algebraic condition for the plane not to intersect the ellipsoid?

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

The tangent plane to the ellipsoid at (X, Y, Z) is Xx/a<sup>2</sup> + Yy/b<sup>2</sup> + Zz/c<sup>2</sup> = 1. It is parallel to Ax + By + Cz + 1 = 0 iff X/a<sup>2</sup> = kA, Y/b<sup>2</sup> = kB, Z/c<sup>2</sup> = kC for some k. But 1 = X<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup> + Y<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup> + Z<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup> = k<sup>2</sup>(a<sup>2</sup>A<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>B<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>C<sup>2</sup>) = k<sup>2</sup>m<sup>2</sup>, so k = &plusmn;1/m. There are two values corresponding to two parallel tangent planes (one on either side of the ellipse). The equation of the tangent plane is k(Ax + By + Cz) = 1.

<p>

The distance of the origin from the plane Ax + By + Cz + 1 = 0 is 1/(A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup> + C<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup> = h. The distance of the origin from the tangent plane k(Ax + By + Cz) = 1 is h/|k| = hm. So if m &ge; 1, the plane Ax + By + Cz + 1 = 0 lies between the two tangent planes and hence intersects the ellipse. So in this case the minimum distance is zero. If m &lt; 1, then the distance between the plane Ax + By + Cz + 1 = 0 and the nearer tangent plane is h(1 - m) and that is the required shortest distance.
