<b>Problem A3</b><br>

<p>

Find all solutions to p<sup>n</sup> = q<sup>m</sup> &plusmn; 1, where p and q are primes and m, n &ge; 2.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: 2<sup>3</sup> = 3<sup>2</sup> - 1.

<p>

p<sup>n</sup> and q<sup>m</sup> have opposite parity, so one must be even. So without loss of generality we may take p = 2. Now q<sup>m</sup> &plusmn; 1 factors as (q &plusmn; 1) and a sum of m powers of q, each of which is odd. If m is odd, then the sum is odd, but that is impossible, since 2<sup>n</sup> has no odd factors. So m is even. Take it to be 2M. 

<p>

Consider first the case 2<sup>n</sup> = q<sup>2M</sup> - 1 = (q<sup>M</sup> + 1)(q<sup>M</sup> - 1). But q<sup>M</sup> + 1 and q<sup>M</sup> - 1 are successive even numbers, so one of them has an odd factor (which is impossible) unless then are 4 and 2. Thus the only solution of this type is 2<sup>3</sup> = 3<sup>2</sup> - 1.

<p>

Finally consider 2<sup>n</sup> = q<sup>2M</sup> + 1. q<sup>M</sup> is odd, so put q<sup>M</sup> = 2N + 1, then q<sup>2M</sup> + 1 = 4N<sup>2</sup> + 4N + 2, which is not divisible by 4. So n = 1 and q = 1, which is not a solution, since 1 is not prime.
