<b>Problem A2</b><br>

<p>

Given any five points in the interior of a square side 1, show that two of the points are a distance apart less than k = 1/&radic;2. Is this result true for a smaller k?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

<i>Easy.</i>

<p>

Let the square be ABCD and O its midpoint. Let the midpoints of AB, BC, CD, DA be P, Q, R, S respectively. Then ABCD is the union of the 4 smaller squares: APOS, BQOP, CROQ, DSOR, each with diameter k. At least one of the smaller squares must contain two points. So the two points are a distance apart &le; k. However, they cannot be a distance k apart, because the only pairs of points in a square realizing the diameter distance are opposite corners and they are not in the interior of ABCD. Hence the two points are a distance &lt; k.

<p>

Take one point at O and the others on the main diagonals a distance &epsilon; from the corners. Then shortest distance between two points is k - &epsilon; which can be made arbitarily close to k.
