<b>Problem B7</b><br>

<p>

R is the reals. f <b>:</b> [a, b] &rarr; R is continuous and &int;<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup> x<sup>n</sup>f(x) dx = 0 for all non-negative integers n. Show that f(x) = 0 for all x.

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

We deduce immediately that &int;<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup> x<sup>n</sup>f(x) p(x) dx = 0 for any polynomial p(x). We now need the Weierstrass approximation theorem: we can uniformly approximate any continuous function on a compact set by polynomials. In other words, we can find a polynomial p(x) such that |f(x) - p(x)| &lt; &epsilon; for all x in [a, b]. Also, since [a, b] is compact, f must be bounded, say by k, so |f(x)| &lt; k for all x in [a, b]. Now we have that |&int;<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup>f(x)<sup>2</sup> dx| = |&int; f(x) (f(x) - p(x)) dx| &le; &int; |f(x)| |f(x) - p(x)| dx &le; (b - a) k &epsilon;, which can be made arbitrarily small by choosing &epsilon; sufficiently small. Hence &int;<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup>f(x)<sup>2</sup> dx = 0, so f(x) = 0 throughout the interval.
