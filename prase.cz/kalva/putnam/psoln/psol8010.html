<b>Problem B4</b><br>

<p>

S is a finite set with subsets S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, ... , S<sub>1066</sub> each containing more than half the elements of S. Show that we can find T &sube; S with |T| &le; 10, such that all T &cap; S<sub>i</sub> are non-empty.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let |S| = n. Consider the number of pairs (x, X) with x &isin; S and X one of the 1066 subsets. There are &gt; n/2 pairs (x, X<sub>0</sub>) for a given X<sub>0</sub>, and hence more than 533n in total. Hence there is an x<sub>1</sub> which is in at least 534 subsets. That leaves &le; 532 subsets. Each of these contains &gt; n/2 elements of S - {x<sub>1</sub>}, so by the same argument we can find x<sub>2</sub> so that the number of subsets not containing either x<sub>1</sub> or x<sub>2</sub> is at most 265. Similarly, we can find x<sub>3</sub>, so that at most 132 subsets do not intersect {x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>}. Continuing, the sequence goes 65, 32, 15, 7, 3, 1, 0 for ten elements.
