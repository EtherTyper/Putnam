<b>Problem A2</b><br>

<p>

M and N are real unequal n x n matrices satisfying M<sup>3</sup> = N<sup>3</sup> and M<sup>2</sup>N = N<sup>2</sup>M. Can we choose M and N so that M<sup>2</sup> + N<sup>2</sup> is invertible?

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: No.

<p>Easy.

<p>The only difficulty is that we are not told whether or not it is true. So one has to (1) try experimenting a little to find invertible M, N satisfying the conditions, and (2) try proving you cannot find such M, N. If you have bad luck you will try in that order!

<p>(M<sup>2</sup> + N<sup>2</sup>)M = M<sup>3</sup> + N<sup>2</sup>M = N<sup>3</sup> + M<sup>2</sup>N = (M<sup>2</sup> + N<sup>2</sup>)N. But now if M<sup>2</sup> + N<sup>2</sup> was invertible, we could multiply by its inverse to get M = N, whereas we are told M and N are unequal.
