<b>Problem B3</b><br>

<p>

Let p be a positive real, let S be the parabola y<sup>2</sup> = 4px, and let P be a point with coordinates (a, b). Show that there are 1, 2 or 3 normals from P to S according as 4(2p - a)<sup>2</sup> + 27 pb<sup>2</sup> &gt;, = or &lt; 0.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Straightforward.

<p>

The general point on the parabola is (pt<sup>2</sup>, 2pt). The slope of the tangent is 2p/y = 1/t, and so the slope of the normal is -t. Hence the equation of the normal is &nbsp; (y - 2pt) = -t(x - pt<sup>2</sup>). This passes through (a, b) iff &nbsp; pt<sup>3</sup> + (2p - a)t - b = 0 (*).

<p>
This is a cubic, so it has 1, 2 or 3 real roots. We have to decide which. If (2p - a) &gt; 0, then pt<sup>3</sup> + (2p - a)t is strictly increasing and takes all values in (-&infin;, &infin;), so (*) has just one real root. The same is true if (2p - a) = 0, unless b = 0, in which case there are three coincident roots.

<p>
If (2p - a) &lt; 0, then pt<sup>3</sup> + (2p - a)t has a maximum and a minimum. Differentiating, we find that these are at t = &plusmn; &radic;( -(2p - a)/(3p) ), with values &plusmn; 2(2p - a)/3 &radic;( -(2p - a)/(3p) ). So there are 1, 2 or 3 real roots according as b<sup>2</sup> &gt;, = or &lt; 4(2p - a)<sup>2</sup>/9 -(2p - a)/3p, which is the condition in the question. Note that if (2p - a) &ge; 0, then this expression is certainly &gt; 0, so the same rule applies.
