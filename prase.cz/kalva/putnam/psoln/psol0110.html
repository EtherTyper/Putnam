<b>Problem B4</b><br>

<p>

Let X be the set of rationals excluding 0, &plusmn;1. Let f: X &rarr; X be defined as f(x) = x - 1/x. Let f<sup>1</sup>(x) = f(x), f<sup>2</sup>(x) = f(f(x)), f<sup>3</sup>(x) = f(f<sup>2</sup>(x)) etc. Does there exist a value x in X such that for any positive integer n, we can find y in X with f<sup>n</sup>(y) = x?

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: no.

<p>

The basic idea is to notice that m/n - n/m = (m<sup>2</sup> - n<sup>2</sup>)/(mn) and that mn is greater than n. So as we iterate f the denominators increase without limit.

<p>

There are a few details. Assume that m, n are relatively prime. Then so are (m<sup>2</sup> - n<sup>2</sup>) and mn, so the denominator of f(m/n) is mn. Clearly if m &gt; 1, then mn &ge; 2n. If m = 1, then we have f(1/n) = (1 - n<sup>2</sup>)/n, which has numerator &gt; 2 (since in this case n cannot be &plusmn;1). So for k &gt; 1, the denominator of f<sup>k+1</sup>(y)  is at least double that of f<sup>k</sup>(y). In particular, it is at least 2<sup>k</sup>. So given any rational x, take 2<sup>k-1</sup> larger than its denominator and we cannot have f<sup>k</sup>(y) = x for any y.
