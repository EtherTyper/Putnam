<b>Problem B5</b><br>

<p>

Let n be the decimal integer 11...1 (with 1998 digits). What is the 1000th digit after the decimal point of &radic;n?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: 1.

<p><i>Fairly easy.</i>

<p>
A little experimentation suggests that if n is the integer with 2m decimal digits, all of them 1, then &radic;n has m 3s, followed by a decimal point, followed by m 3s, followed by a 1, followed by some 6s. If true, that would imply that the required digit was 1.

<p>
n = (10<sup>2m</sup> - 1)/9. Let x = (10<sup>m</sup> - 10<sup>-m</sup>)/3, then x has m 3s followed by a decimal point, followed by m 3s. So we have to show that (x + 10<sup>-m-1</sup>)<sup>2</sup> &lt; n and (x + 2.10<sup>-m-1</sup>)<sup>2</sup> &gt; n. That is a straightforward computation.
