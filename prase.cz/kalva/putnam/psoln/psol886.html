<b>Problem A6</b><br>

<p>

V is an n-dimensional vector space. Can we find a linear map A : V &rarr; V with n+1 eigenvectors, any n of which are linearly independent, which is not a scalar multiple of the identity?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: no.

<p>

Let the n+1 corresponding eigenvalues have sum k. Given any eigenvector with eigenvalue &lambda;, the remaining n eigenvectors form a basis (since they are linearly independent) which diagonalises the matrix of the linear map. The resulting matrix has trace k - &lambda;. But trace is independent of basis, so all the &lambda; are the same and the diagonalised matrix is just a multiple &lambda; of the identity. In other words, the linear map is just a scalar multiple of the identity.
