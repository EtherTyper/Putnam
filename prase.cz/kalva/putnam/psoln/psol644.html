<b>Problem A4</b><br>

<p>

The sequence of integers u<sub>n</sub> is bounded and satisfies u<sub>n</sub> = (u<sub>n-1</sub> + u<sub>n-2</sub> + u<sub>n-3</sub>u<sub>n-4</sub>)/(u<sub>n-1</sub>u<sub>n-2</sub> + u<sub>n-3</sub> + u<sub>n-4</sub>). Show that it is periodic for sufficiently large n.

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

This is almost trivial. The u<sub>n</sub> are bounded and integral, so there are only <i>finitely</i> many possible values. Hence there are only finitely many possible values for the 4-tuples (u<sub>n-1</sub>, u<sub>n-2</sub>, u<sub>n-3</sub>, u<sub>n-4</sub>). So we must eventually get a repeat. Suppose the t-tuples are the same for n = N and n = N+M. Then the recurrence relation implies that they must also be the same for n = N+1 and n = N+M+1, and for n = N+2 and N+M+2 and so on. In other words the sequence is periodic (with period M) from this point onwards.
