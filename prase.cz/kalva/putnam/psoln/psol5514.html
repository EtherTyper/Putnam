<b>Problem B7</b><br>

<p>

A three-dimensional solid acted on by four constant forces is in equilibrium. No two lines of force are in the same plane. Show that the four lines of force are rulings on a hyperboloid.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let the lines be L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, L<sub>3</sub>, L<sub>4</sub>. If the line L intersects each of L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, L<sub>3</sub>, then the moment of the first three forces about L is zero. Hence the moment of the fourth force about L is also zero and so L must also intersect L<sub>4</sub>. This is sufficient to prove that L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, L<sub>3</sub>, L<sub>4</sub> lie in a ruled quadric.

<p>

In fact the union of all the lines which intersect L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, L<sub>3</sub> is a ruled quadric. Let P be a point on L<sub>4</sub>. For a point X and a line L not containing it we take XL to be the unique plane containing X and L. If L and L' are skew lines and X does not lie on either, then XL &cap; XL' is the unique line through X which meets L and L'. So PL<sub>1</sub> &cap; PL<sub>2</sub> is the unique line through P which meets L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>. Suppose it meets L<sub>1</sub> at Q. Now QL<sub>2</sub> &cap; QL<sub>3</sub> meets L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>3</sub> so it must also meet L<sub>4</sub>. But there is a unique line through Q meeting L<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>4</sub>, so QL<sub>2</sub> &cap; QL<sub>3</sub> = PL<sub>1</sub> &cap; PL<sub>2</sub>. Hence P lies on the line QL<sub>2</sub> &cap; QL<sub>3</sub> which is a line of the quadric. P was arbitrary, so we have shown that L<sub>4</sub> lies in the quadric.
