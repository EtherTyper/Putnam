<b>Problem B3</b><br>

<p>

Can we find N such that all m x n rectangles with m, n &gt; N can be tiled with 4 x 6 and 5 x 7 rectangles?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: yes.

<p>Moderately easy.

<p>If a and b are relatively prime then we can express any integer N &gt; ab as N = ra + sb with r and s positive integers. For a proof, take a &gt; b, and observe that N, N - b, N - 2b, N - (a - 1)b are all positive and incongruent mod a, so they must constitute a complete set of residues mod a. In particular, we can find one which is congruent to zero mod a.

<p>We can tile 35 x 5 and 35 x 7 using just 5 x 7 rectangles. But 5 and 7 are relatively prime, so we can use 35 x 5 and 35 x 7 rectangles to tile any 35 x n rectangle for n &gt; 35. Similarly, we can tile 24 x 4 and 24 x 6 using just 4 x 6 rectangles. 4 and 6 have greatest common divisor 2, so we can use 24 x 4 and 24 x 6 rectangles to tile any 24 x 2n rectangle for n &gt; 24. But 24 and 35 are relatively prime so for any 2n &gt; 48, and m &gt; 840 we can use 35 x 2n and 24 x 2n rectangles to tile an m x 2n rectangle. Finally, given any m x (2n+1) rectangle with 2n+1 &gt; 83 and m &gt; 840, we can divide it into an m x 35 rectangle and an m x 2n rectangle, each of which can be tiled. So any m x n rectangle can be tiled provided m, n &gt; 840.
