<b>Problem B2</b><br>

<p>

Let f(n) = ( (2n+1)/e )<sup>(2n+1)/2</sup>. Show that for n &gt; 0: f(n-1) &lt; 1.3.5 ... (2n-1) &lt; f(n).

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

<i>Straightforward integration, with one wrinkle.</i>

<p>
We estimate the integral of ln x, which is convex and hence easy to estimate. Take the integral from 1 to 2n-1. This is less than 2(ln 3 + ln 5 + ... + ln(2n-1) ). But the integral of ln x is x ln x - x, so the integral evaluates to (2n-1) ln(2n-1) - 2n + 2. Hence (2n-1) ln(2n-1) - (2n-1) &lt; (2n-1) ln(2n-1) - 2n + 2 &lt; 2(ln 3 + ln 5 + ... + ln(2n-1)). Exponentiating gives the left hand inequality.

<p>
Similarly, the integral from 1 to 2n+1 is greater than 2(ln 3 + ln 5 + ... + ln(2n-1) ). However, this is not quite good enough, because the integral evaluates to (2n+1) ln(2n+1) - 2n, and this time the odd 1 works against us. However, we can slightly improve our estimate. Because ln 1 = 0, our estimate treated the integral from 1 to 3 as nil, so we can raise the lower end of the integration range: the integral from 3 to 2n+1 is greater than 2(ln 3 + ln 5 + ... + ln(2n-1) ). Actually, it is more convenient to take the lower bound as e &lt; 3, because then x ln x - x evaluates to 0 at the lower bound, thus getting rid of the odd 1. Exponentiating now gives the right hand inequality.
