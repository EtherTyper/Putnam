<b>Problem A4</b><br>

<p>

A notch is cut in a cylindrical vertical tree trunk. The notch penetrates to the axis of the cylinder and is bounded by two half-planes. Each half-plane is bounded by a horizontal line passing through the axis of the cylinder. The angle between the two half-planes is &theta;. Prove that the volume of the notch is minimized (for given tree and &theta;) by taking the bounding planes at equal angles to the horizontal plane.

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

We find the volume of the notch above the horizontal plane. Suppose that the upper bounding half-plane is at an angle &phi; to the horizontal. We may take the radius of the tree to be 1. A vertical section through the notch at a distance x from its widest extent is a right-angled triangle with base &radic;(1 - x<sup>2</sup>) and area 1/2 (1 - x<sup>2</sup>) tan &phi;. Hence the volume is 2/3 tan &phi;. So the total volume of the notch is 2/3 (tan &phi; + tan(&theta;-&phi;) ). So we have to find the angle &phi; which minimises (tan &phi; + tan(&theta; - &phi;). Differentiating, or otherwise, we easily find that the minimum is at &phi;/2.
