<b>Problem B4</b><br>

<p>

Can we find four distinct concentric circles all touching an ellipse?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: yes, we can find four such circles for any ellipse except the circle.

<p>

We show first that we can find four such circles for any non-circular ellipse. Let the ellipse have centre O, major axis AB (length 2a) and minor axis CD (length 2b). Take a point P with OP &lt; (a - b)/2. Then using the triangle inequality we have PA &gt; OA - OP = (a + b)/2, PB &gt; OB - OP = (a + b)/2. PC &lt; OC + OP = (a + b)/2, PD &lt; OD + OP = (a + b)/2. Put k = (a + b)/2. Then, if Q is a point on the ellipse, (PQ - k) is positive at A and B and negative at C and D. Hence there must be at least four points Q on the ellipse at which it is stationary and hence at which PQ is normal to the ellipse. There is a point A' near A which is a maximum and hence has PA' &gt; k. Similarly, there is a point B' near B with PB' &gt; k. There is a point C' near C with PC' &lt; k and a point D' near D with PD' &lt; k. Let us assume that P is in the quadrant AOC and not on either axis. The reflection D'' of D' in the line AB lies at or near C' and hence has PD'' &gt;= PC' (which is known to be a minimum). Put P lies closer to D'' than to D'. Hence PC' &lt; PD'. A similar argument shows that PB' &gt; PA'. So we have PB' &gt; PA' &gt; k &gt; PD' &gt; PC'. Thus the circles centre P through A', B', C' and D' are all distinct and all touch the ellipse.

<p>

Note that we cannot find 4 circles in the case when the ellipse is circular. For given a point P and a circle E centre O, a circle centre P can only touch E on the line OP, but that implies there can only be two such circles.
