<b>Problem A4</b><br>

<p>

Sketch the curve y<sup>4</sup> - x<sup>4</sup> - 96y<sup>2</sup> + 100x<sup>2</sup> = 0.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

The graph is in three parts. It is symmetrical on reflection in the x-axis and on reflection in the y-axis. The central part is a figure of 8 with crossing point at the origin and touching the lines y/x = &plusmn;&radic;(100/96). The top and bottom of the figure of 8 are at (0, &plusmn;&radic;96). The right hand part is a sort of dimpled hyperbola with asymptotes y/x = &plusmn;1. It comes in along each asymptote and touches the line x = 8 at y = &plusmn;&radic;48, then it dimples back away from the origin to cut the x-axis at x = 10. The left hand part of the curve is just the reflection of this in the y-axis.
