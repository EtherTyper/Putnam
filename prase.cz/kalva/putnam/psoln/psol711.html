<b>Problem A1</b><br>

<p>

Given any 9 lattice points in space, show that we can find two which have a lattice point on the interior of the segment joining them.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

We can divide the points into 8 categories according to the parity of each coordinate. There must be at least 2 points in the same category. The midpoint of the line joining them is then also a lattice point.

<p>

<i>Comment. If you have not seen this trick before, the question is hard.</i>
