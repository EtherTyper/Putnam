<b>Problem B4</b><br>

<p>

Let P be a point inside a continuous closed curve in the plane which does not intersect itself. Show that we can find two points on the curve whose midpoint is P.

<b>Solution</b><br>

<i>The solution I put up was as follows:</i>

<p>

Take an arbitrary chord AB through P. If P is the midpoint then we are done. So assume it is not. Let A' complete a circuit of the curve starting at A and returning to it. Let the chord through A' and P be A'B'. Let f(A') = A'P/B'P. Then f is a continuous function and f(A<sub>start</sub>) = 1/f(A<sub>finish</sub>). So for some point C on the curve f must assume the intermediate value 1, which means that P is the midpoint of this chord.

<p>

<i>However, that is not quite right if the curve is as illustrated above, since defining A' does not unambiguously define B'. Moreover, we cannot simply move A' around the curve -  we may get stuck and have to move it back a little way in order to allow B' to complete a circuit. This can probably be rescued, but there is a neater solution due to P Mason (who also pointed out the error above).</i>

<p>

Let C be the curve and C' the curve obtained by rotating C through 180<sup>o</sup> about P. Let m be a point on C closest to P, and M a point on C furthest from P. Then m must lie inside or on C', and M must lie outside or on C'. Hence C and C' must intersect. Take Q to be any common point. Then the point Q' obtained by rotating Q through 180<sup>o</180> must also lie on C and C'. Now P is the midpoint of QQ'.
