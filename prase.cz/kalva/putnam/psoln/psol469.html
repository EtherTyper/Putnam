<b>Problem B3</b><br>

<p>

The density of a solid sphere depends solely on the radial distance. The gravitational force at any point inside the sphere, a distance r from the center, is kr<sup>2</sup> (where k is a constant). Find the density (in terms of G, k and r), and the gravitational force at a point outside the sphere. [You may assume the usual results about the gravitational attraction of a spherical shell.]

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

A shell exerts no net attraction on a point inside and acts on a point outside as if all its mass was concentrated at its center. So let the density at a radial distance r be &rho;(r). Then G/r<sup>2</sup> &int;<sub>0</sub><sup>r</sup> 4&pi;t<sup>2</sup>&rho;(t) dt = kr<sup>2</sup>. Hence &int;<sub>0</sub><sup>r</sup> t<sup>2</sup>&rho;(t) dt = k/(4G&pi;) r<sup>4</sup>. Differentiating: r<sup>2</sup>&rho;(r) = k/(G&pi;) r<sup>3</sup>. So &rho;(r) = k/(G&pi;) r.

<p>

The force at the surface of the sphere (R) is kR<sup>2</sup>. Hence the force at a distance r &gt; R from the center of the sphere is kR<sup>4</sup>/r<sup>2</sup>. [We know the force is a simple inverse square law outside the sphere and it must be continuous at the surface.]
