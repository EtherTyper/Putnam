<b>Problem B1</b><br>

<p>

Find all pairs of unequal integers m, n such that m<sup>n</sup> = n<sup>m</sup>.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: (2, 4), (4, 2), (-2, -4), (-4, -2).

<p>

Suppose first that m and n are both positive. Assume m &gt; n. Then we can put m = n + k with k &gt; 0. Hence (1 + k/n)<sup>n</sup> = n<sup>k</sup>. But for x &gt; 1 we have 1 + x &lt; e<sup>x</sup> (the derivative of f(x) = e<sup>x</sup> - x - 1 is positive and f(0) = 0) and hence (1 + k/n)<sup>n</sup> &lt; e<sup>k</sup>. So there are no solutions for n &gt; 2. If n = 1, then n<sup>m</sup> = 1 and hence m = 1, contradicting the fact that m and n are unequal. If n = 2, then m must be a power of 2. Suppose m = 2<sup>h</sup>. Then we find h = 1 or 2. h = 1 is invalid (because m and n are unequal), so m = 4. There is also the corresponding solution with m &lt; n.

<p>

If n &lt; 0 and m &gt; 0, then n<sup>m</sup> = 1/m<sup>-n</sup>. So m divides 1 and hence m = 1. But m must be even for to make n<sup>m</sup>  positive. Contradiction. So there are no solutions of this type. If m and n are both negative, then -m, -n is a solution, so the only possibilities are (-2, -4) and (-4, -2) and it is readily checked that these are indeed solutions.
