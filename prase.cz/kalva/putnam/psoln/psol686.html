<b>Problem A6</b><br>

<p>

Find all finite polynomials whose coefficients are all &plusmn;1 and whose roots are all real.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: &plusmn;(x + 1), &plusmn;(x - 1), &plusmn;(x<sup>2</sup> + x - 1), &plusmn;(x<sup>2</sup> - x - 1), &plusmn;(x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> - x - 1), &plusmn;(x<sup>3</sup> - x<sup>2</sup> - x + 1).

<p>

The linear and quadratic polynomials are easy to find (and it is easy to show that they are the only ones).

<p>

Suppose the polynomial has degree n &ge; 3. Let the roots be k<sub>i</sub>. Then &sum; k<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> = (&sum; k<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup> - 2 &sum; k<sub>i</sub>k<sub>j</sub> = a<sup>2</sup> &plusmn; 2b, where a is the coefficient of x<sup>n-1</sup> and b is the coefficient of x<sup>n-2</sup>. Hence the arithmetic mean of the squares of the roots is (a<sup>2</sup> &plusmn; 2b)/n. But it is at least as big as the geometric mean which is 1 (because it is an even power of c, the constant term). So we cannot have n &gt; 3. For n = 3, we must have b the opposite sign to the coefficient of x<sup>n</sup> and it is then easy to check that the only possibilities are those given above.
