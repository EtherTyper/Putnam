<b>Problem B5</b><br>

<p>

A quadrilateral is inscribed in a circle radius 1. Two opposite sides are parallel. The difference between their lengths is d &gt; 0. The distance from the intersection of the diagonals to the center of the circle is h. Find sup d/h and describe the cases in which it is attained.

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

The tricky part is deciding what to use as variables. Take x, y coordinates centered on the center of the circle. Assume that the diagonals intersect at (0, h) and that one of the diagonals has gradient m, so that it has equation y = mx + h. Then it cuts the circle at x-coordinates x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub> which are the roots of the quadratic: x<sup>2</sup> + (mx + h)<sup>2</sup> = 1, or (m<sup>2</sup> + 1)x<sup>2</sup> + 2mhx - (1 - h<sup>2</sup>) = 0. Since one root is positive and the other negative we have that d = 2 x sum of roots = 4mh/(m<sup>2</sup> + 1). So d/h = 2. 2m/(m<sup>2</sup> + 1). But (m - 1)<sup>2</sup> &ge; 0 implies 2m/(m<sup>2</sup> + 1) &ge; 1, with equality iff m = 1. Hence sup d/h = 2, with equality when the diagonals are perpendicular.
