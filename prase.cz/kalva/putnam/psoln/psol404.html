<b>Problem A4</b><br>

<p>

p is a positive constant. Let R is the curve y<sup>2</sup> = 4px. Let S be the mirror image of R in the y-axis (y<sup>2</sup> = - 4px). R remains fixed and S rolls around it without slipping. O is the point of S initially at the origin. Find the equation for the locus of O as S rolls.

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Straightforward.

<p>Answer: x(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>) + 2p y<sup>2</sup> = 0.

<p>Take the point of contact as (X, Y), so Y<sup>2</sup> = 4pX. The tangent at to R at this point has gradient 2p/Y, and hence has equation (y - Y) = 2p/Y (x - X). The perpendicular to the tangent through the origin has equation x = - 2p/Y y. If (x, y) is their point of intersection, then (2x, 2y) is the point O (since S in its new position is the reflection of R in the tangent). 

<p>Solving for x, y: y = Y<sup>3</sup>/(2(Y<sup>2</sup> + 4p<sup>2</sup>) ), x = - 2p/Y = - pY/(Y<sup>2</sup> + 4p<sup>2</sup>). So the point O is (-2pY<sup>2</sup>/(Y<sup>2</sup> + 4p<sup>2</sup>),  Y<sup>3</sup>/(Y<sup>2</sup> + 4p<sup>2</sup>) ) (*). Using Y = -2py/x, we get x = -2py<sup>2</sup>/(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>), or x(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>) + 2p y<sup>2</sup> = 0 (**). We have shown that the locus is given by (*) and that all points on (*) are on (**). However, we must check that (**) does not include additional points. Writing (**) as y<sup>2</sup> = - x<sup>3</sup>/(x + 2p), shows that for each value of x in the range (-2p, 0) there are exactly two possible values of y, and the only other point on (**) is the origin. Inspection shows that the same is true for (*), so the two expressions are equivalent.
