<b>Problem B1</b><br>

<p>

We are given N triples of integers (a<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>), (a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>), ... (a<sub>N</sub>, b<sub>N</sub>, c<sub>N</sub>). At least one member of each triple is odd. Show that we can find integers A, B, C such that at least 4N/7 of the N values A a<sub>i</sub> + B b<sub>i</sub> + C c<sub>i</sub> are odd.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Evidently we are only interested in the residues of the integers mod 2. So there are 7 possibilities for the each triple: (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1). These are also the possibilities for (A, B, C).

<p>It is easy to verify that if we take any fixed triple (a, b, c), then just 4 of the 7 possibilities for Aa + Bb + Cc are odd. So given any set of N triples, just 4N of the 7N sums Aa<sub>i</sub> + Bb<sub>i</sub> + Cc<sub>i</sub> are odd. These are divided into 7 sets (corresponding to the 7 possibilities for (A, B, C) ), so at least one of the these sets must contain at least 4N/7 odds.
