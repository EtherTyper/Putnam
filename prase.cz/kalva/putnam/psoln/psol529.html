<b>Problem B2</b><br>

<p>

Find the surface comprising the curves which satisfy dx/(yz) = dy/(zx) = dz/(xy) and which meet the circle x = 0, y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> = 1.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

We have x dx = y dy = z dz. Integrating, y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> + h,  z<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> + k (*). We are told that some point of the circle x = 0, y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> = 1 belongs to the curve, so h and k must be non-negative with sum 1. Hence the curve (*) lies in the surface 2 x<sup>2</sup> + 1 = y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup>, which is a one-sheet hyperboloid with the x-axis as an axis of symmetry. However, not all points of this surface lie on a curve (*). Clearly we require |y| &gt;= |x| and |z| &ge; |x|. Equally, it is clear that this is a sufficient condition for we can then find h, k to satisfy (*).
