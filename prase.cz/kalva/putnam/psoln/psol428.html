<b>Problem B2</b>

<p>

Let P<sub>a</sub> be the parabola y = a<sup>3</sup>x<sup>2</sup>/3 + a<sup>2</sup>x/2 - 2a. Find the locus of the vertices of P<sub>a</sub>, and the envelope of P<sub>a</sub>. Sketch the envelope and two P<sub>a</sub>.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b>

<p>

We can write the equation of P<sub>a</sub> as (y + 35a/16) = (a<sup>3</sup>/3)(x + 3/4a)<sup>2</sup>, so the vertex is x = -3/4a, y = -35a/16. The locus of the vertex is xy = 105/64.

<p>
The graph shows P<sub>3</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>1/2</sub>, P<sub>1/3</sub> and the two hyperbolae yx = -7/6, yx = 10/3. It shows that for positive a, the parabolas touch the lower branches of the hyperbolae. For negative a they touch the upper branches.
<p>
That is not hard to verify. We claim that P<sub>a</sub> and xy = 10/3 touch at x = -2/a, y = -5a/3. The point obviously lies on xy = 10/3. We have (a<sup>3</sup>/3)(x + 3/4a)<sup>2</sup> = (1/3)(-2 + 3/4)<sup>2</sup> a = 25a/48 = (-5a/3 + 35a/16), so the point also lies on P<sub>a</sub>. The gradient of xy = 10/3 at the point is -10/(3x<sup>2</sup>) = -5a<sup>2</sup>/6. The gradient of P<sub>a</sub> at the point is 2a<sup>3</sup>x/3 + a<sup>2</sup>/2 = -5a<sup>2</sup>/6.
<p>
Similarly, we claim that P<sub>a</sub> and xy = -7/6 touch at x = 1/a, y = -7a/6. The point obviously lies on xy = -7/6. We have (a<sup>3</sup>/3)(x + 3/4a)<sup>2</sup> = (a/3)(1 + 3/4)<sup>2</sup> = 49a/48 = (-7a/6 + 35a/16), so the point also lies on P<sub>a</sub>. The gradient of xy = -7/6 at the point is 7/(6x<sup>2</sup>) = 7a<sup>2</sup>/6. The gradient of P<sub>a</sub> at the point is 2a<sup>3</sup>x/3 + a<sup>2</sup>/2 = a<sup>2</sup>(2/3 + 1/2) = 7a<sup>2</sup>/6.
<p>
It is less clear how you get the hyperbolas. One standard approach is to look for the singular points of the mapping f(a,t) = (t, a<sup>3</sup>t<sup>2</sup>/3 + a<sup>2</sup>t/2 - 2a). The matrix for the derivative is:
<pre>
    1           0
2a<sup>3</sup>t/3+a<sup>2</sup>/2   a<sup>2</sup>t<sup>2</sup>+at-2

</pre>
which has zero determinant when at = 1 or -2, so xy = 7/6 or -10/3.
