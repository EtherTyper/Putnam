<b>Problem B4</b><br>

<p>

A is a set of 5 x 7 real matrices closed under scalar multiplication and addition. It contains matrices of ranks 0, 1, 2, 4 and 5. Does it necessarily contain a matrix of rank 3?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: no.

<p>

The 5 x 7 is something of a red herring. Note that we would expect the answer to be no, because addition and scalar multiplication do not impose any mixing on the matrix elements.

<p>

Consider the 5 x 5 matrix with a in the first 4 positions on the diagonal, c is the last position, b at positions (4,5) and (5,4) and zeros elsewhere. Taking (a, b, c) = (1, 0, 1), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 0) gives matrices of rank 5, 4, 2, 1, 0 respectively. If a = 0, then all the entries in rows 1, 2 and 3 are zero, so the rank is at most 2. If a is non-zero, then there is certainly a 4 x 4 unit submatrix, so the rank is at least 4. Thus no member of the set has rank 3.

<p>

If we add two columns of zeros to every member of the set, then we get a counter-example for the 5 x 7 case.
