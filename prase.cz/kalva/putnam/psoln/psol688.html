<b>Problem B2</b><br>

<p>

(G, *) is a finite group with n elements. K is a subset of G with more than n/2 elements. Prove that for every g &isin; G, we can find h, k &isin; K such that g = h * k.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Take any g in G. Let H be the set of elements of the form h<sup>-1</sup>*g where h is in K. Since G is a group, H has the same number of elements as K. Hence it must overlap K (since between them they have more than n elements). So for some h, k in K we have k = h<sup>-1</sup>*g, or g = h*k.
