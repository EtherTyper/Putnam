<b>Problem B3</b><br>

<p>

F is a finite field with n elements. n is odd. x<sup>2</sup> + bx + c is an irreducible polynomial over F. For how many elements d &isin; F is x<sup>2</sup> + bx + c + d irreducible?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Since n is odd, h &ne; -h for any h &isin; F. So there are exactly (n + 1)/2 quadratic residues. Since n is odd, we may write b as 2k, and so we are interested in d for which (x + k)<sup>2</sup> = k<sup>2</sup> - c - d is irreducible. In other words, d for which k<sup>2</sup> - c - d is a quadratic non-residue. But k<sup>2</sup> - c - d runs through all the elements of F, so there are just (n - 1)/2 values of d which give a quadratic non-residue.
