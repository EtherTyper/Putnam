<b>Problem A6</b><br>

<p>

X is a subset of the rationals which is closed under addition and multiplication. 0 &notin; X. For any rational x &ne; 0, just one of x, -x &isin; X. Show that X is the set of all positive rationals.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Either x or -x belongs to X. X is closed under multiplication, so the square x<sup>2</sup> = (-x)<sup>2</sup> belongs to X. In particular, 1 belongs to X. Hence by repeated addition all positive integers must belong to X. Suppose positive rational m/n does not belong to X. Then -m/n does, and hence by repeated addition -m. So m does not belong to X. Contradiction. So X contains all positive rationals. But if x is in X, -x is not, so X does not contain any negative rationals and hence X is just the set of all positive rationals.
