<b>Problem A4</b><br>

<p>

How many real roots does 2<sup>x</sup> = 1 + x<sup>2</sup> have?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: 3. x = 0, x = 1 and a value just over 4.

<p>

Clearly there are no roots for negative x, since for such x, 2<sup>x</sup> &lt; 1, whereas 1 + x<sup>2</sup> &gt; 1. There are certainly roots at x = 0 and 1. Also 2<sup>4</sup> &lt; 4<sup>2</sup> + 1, whereas 2<sup>5</sup> &gt; 5<sup>2</sup> + 1, so there is a root between 4 and 5. We have to show that there are no other roots. Put f(x) = 2<sup>x</sup> - x<sup>2</sup> - 1. Then f ''(x) = (ln 2)<sup>2</sup> 2<sup>x</sup> - 2. This is strictly increasing with a single zero. f '(0) &gt; 0, so f '(x) starts positive, decreases through zero to a minimum, then increases through zero. So it has just two zeros. Hence f(x) has at most three zeros, which we have already found.
