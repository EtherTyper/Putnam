<b>Problem B6</b><br>

<p>

f <b>:</b> [0, 2&pi;) &rarr; [-1, 1] satisfies f(x) = &sum;<sub>0</sub><sup>n</sup> (a<sub>j</sub> sin jx + b<sub>j</sub> cos jx) for some real constants a<sub>j</sub>, b<sub>j</sub>. Also |f(x)| = 1 for just 2n distinct values in the interval. Show that f(x) = cos(nx + k) for some k.

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

We call f(x) a trigonometric sum of degree n. Let x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ... , x<sub>2n</sub> be the points at which f(x) = 1 or -1. Two insights are needed. The first is that f '(x<sub>i</sub>) = 0. For if the value was non-zero, then f(x) would lie outside [-1, 1] for points sufficiently close (and on the correct side). [Note that there is a minor complication at 0. If f(0) = 1 and f '(0) &lt; 0, then the aberrant points would be just less than 2&pi;.]

<p>

The second is that if a trigonometric sum of degree n has 2n roots (counting multiplicities), then it is determined up to a multiplicative constant (and if it has more than 2n roots then it is identically zero). We will establish that later. But 1 - f(x)<sup>2</sup> has the 2n roots x<sub>i</sub>. Also, they all have multiplicity at least 2 since f '(x<sub>i</sub>) = 0. So we have at least 4n roots (counting multiplicities). Using the familiar formulae cos(A + B) etc we can write 1 - f(x)<sup>2</sup> in the same form as f(x) but with the sum from 0 to 2n.

<p>

Similarly, f '(x) is a trigonometric sum of degree n with the 2n roots x<sub>i</sub>. If we square it, each root is doubled, so f '(x)<sup>2</sup> is a trigonometric sum of degree 2n with the 4n roots x<sub>i</sub> (each counted twice). Hence we must have f '(x)<sup>2</sup> = multiple of (1 - f(x)<sup>2</sup>). Both are non-negative, so it must be a positive multiple. Hence we can take the square root to get f '(x) = N &radic;(1 - f(x)<sup>2</sup> ) for some fixed N. Solving, we get f(x) = cos(Nx + k). But for this to have just 2n values &plusmn;1 we must have N = n.

<p>

To prove the result about trigonometric polynomials put z = e<sup>ix</sup>, then f(x) = z<sup>-n</sup> p(z), where p is a polynomial in z of degree 2n. Hence p has at most 2n roots and is determined by those roots up to a multiplicative constant. Note that if f '(x) = 0 and f(x) = 0, then p(z) = 0 and since 0 = f '(x) = combination of p(z) and p'(z), then p'(z) = 0 also, so double roots of f have corresponding roots of multiplicity at least 2 in p.
