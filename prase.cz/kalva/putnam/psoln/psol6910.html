<b>Problem B4</b><br>

<p>

&Gamma; is a plane curve of length 1. Show that we can find a closed rectangle area 1/4 which covers &Gamma;.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let the endpoints of the curve be A and B. Take lines p, q parallel to AB and on opposite sides of it so that the band between them just covers the curve. Similarly take lines r, s perpendicular to AB so that the band between them just covers the curve (and so that r is nearer to A than to B).

<p>

Reflect A in q to get A<sub>1</sub>. Reflect A<sub>1</sub> in r to get A<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, reflect B in p to get B<sub>1</sub>, then B<sub>1</sub> in s to get B<sub>2</sub>. Consider the line segment A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>. By reflection we can derive from it a curve from A to B consisting of five straight line segments which intersects p, q, r and s. Moreover it is evidently the shortest curve with this property.

<p>

Let X be the distance between r and s, Y the distance between p and q, and Z the distance between A and B. We have (X - 2Y)<sup>2</sup> + (X - Z)<sup>2</sup> + 2X(X - Z) &ge; 0 (*). Hence (2X - Z)<sup>2</sup> + (2Y)<sup>2</sup> &ge; 4XY, which tells us that the square of the length A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> is greater than or equal to four times the area of the rectangle formed by the intersection of the two bands. Thus if the curve &Gamma; has length 1, then A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> must have length at least 1 and hence we have found a rectangle with area at most 1/4 which covers &Gamma;. Note that (*) shows the area will be less than 1/4 unless Z = X (so that r goes through A and s through B) and X = 2Y.
