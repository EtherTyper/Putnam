<b>Problem A6</b><br>

<p>

Let a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ... be a sequence such that: a<sub>0</sub> = 2; each a<sub>n</sub> = 2 or 3; a<sub>n</sub> = the number of 3s between the nth and n+1th 2 in the sequence. So the sequence starts: 233233323332332 ... . Show that we can find &alpha; such that a<sub>n</sub> = 2 iff n = [&alpha;m] for some integer m &ge; 0.

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let b<sub>n</sub> be the index of the nth 2, so b<sub>0</sub> = 0, b<sub>1</sub> = 3, b<sub>2</sub> = 7, b<sub>3</sub> = 11, b<sub>4</sub> = 14, ... . Then we are told that b<sub>n</sub> = (a<sub>0</sub> + 1) + (a<sub>1</sub> + 1) + ... + (a<sub>n-1</sub> + 1). Now each a<sub>i</sub> = 2 or 3, so b<sub>n</sub> = 4n - (number of b<sub>m</sub>s in 0, 1, 2, ... , n-1).

<p>

Suppose that b<sub>n</sub> = [n&alpha;] as claimed. Then the number of b<sub>m</sub>s in 0, 1, ... , n-1 is the number of [m&alpha;] &lt; n, which is the same as the number of (m&alpha;) &lt; n (since &alpha; is irrational). And that is just 1 + [n/&alpha;]. So we have [n&alpha;] = 4n - 1 - [n/&alpha;]. But 4n - [n/&alpha;] = [4n - n/&alpha;] + 1 (since n/&alpha; is irrational), so [n&alpha;] = [4n - n/&alpha;] = [n&beta;], where &beta; = 4 - 1/&alpha;. But this holds for all n, so we must have &beta; = &alpha;. Solving the quadratic gives &alpha; = 2 &plusmn; &radic;3. But clearly &alpha; &gt; 3, so &alpha; = 2 + &radic;3.

<p>

We are not done yet. All we have done is shown that <i>if</i> it is true that b<sub>n</sub> = [n&alpha;] for some &alpha;, then &alpha; must be 2 + &radic;3. But we can work the previous argument in reverse. Suppose we define d<sub>n</sub> = [n(2 + &radic;3)]. Then the argument shows that d<sub>n</sub> = 4n - (number of d<sub>m</sub>s in 0, 1, 2, ... , n-1) and that is sufficient to identify d<sub>n</sub> and b<sub>n</sub>.
