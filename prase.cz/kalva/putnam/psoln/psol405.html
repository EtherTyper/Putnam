<b>Problem A5</b><br>

<p>

Prove that the set of points satisfying x<sup>4</sup> - x<sup>2</sup> = y<sup>4</sup> - y<sup>2</sup> = z<sup>4</sup> - z<sup>2</sup> is the union of 4 straight lines and 6 ellipses.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Straightforward.

<p>

x<sup>4</sup> - x<sup>2</sup> = (x<sup>2</sup> - 1/2)<sup>2</sup> - 1/4, so x<sup>4</sup> - x<sup>2</sup> = y<sup>4</sup> - y<sup>2</sup> is equivalent to (x<sup>2</sup> - 1/2)<sup>2</sup> = (y<sup>2</sup> - 1/2)<sup>2</sup> and hence to x<sup>2</sup> - 1/2 = +/- (y<sup>2</sup> - 1/2), which is equivalent to x = y, or x = -y, or x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 1. Similarly, for y<sup>4</sup> - y<sup>2</sup> = z<sup>4</sup> - z<sup>2</sup>. So the equation given is equivalent to: (1) x = y and y = z, or (2) x = y and y = -z, or (3) x = -y and y = z, or (4) x = -y and y = -z, or (5) x = y and y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> = 1, or (6) x = -y and y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> = 1, or (7) x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 1 and y = z, or (8) x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 1 and y = -z, or (9) x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 1 and y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> = 1.

<p>Clearly (1) - (4) are straight lines. (5) is the intersection of a plane and a cylinder, which is an ellipse. Similarly (6), (7) and (8). (9) is slightly harder to see. If one's visualization is good, then one can see that the intersection of two cylinders with the same radius and axes intersecting at right angles is two perpendicular ellipses with a common minor axis. Otherwise, subtracting the two equations we see that x = z or -z and the intersection is also given by the intersection of a cylinder with two planes.
