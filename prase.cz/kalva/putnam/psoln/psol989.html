<b>Problem B3</b><br>

<p>

Let S be the sphere center the origin and radius 1. Let P be a regular pentagon in the plane z = 0 with vertices on S. Find the surface area of the part of the sphere which lies above (z &gt; 0) P or its interior. 

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: &pi;(5 cos &pi;/5 - 3) = 3.2832.

<p><i>Straightforward.</i>

<p>
Call the area on a sphere bounded by a circle a <i>cap</i>. The <i>depth</i> of the cap is the distance from its central point to the plane through its boundary. A simple integration gives that the area of a cap depth d is 2&pi;rd, where r is the radius of the sphere. In this case the vertical plane through a side of the pentagon defines a cap. The five caps do not overlap and so the area required is (area S - 5 area cap)/2. We have that d = 1 - cos &pi;/5. Hence area required = &pi;(5 cos &pi;/5 - 3).
