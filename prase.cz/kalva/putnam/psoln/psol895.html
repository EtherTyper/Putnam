<b>Problem A5</b><br>

<p>

Show that we can find &alpha; &gt; 0 such that, given any point P inside a regular polygon with an odd number of sides which is inscribed in a circle radius 1, we can find two vertices of the polygon whose distance from P differs by less than 1/n - &alpha;/n<sup>3</sup>, where the polygon has 2n + 1 sides.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

There are 2n+1 distances, all less than 2 (the diameter of the circle), so by the usual pigeon-hole argument there must be two distances differing by less than 2/2n. This is almost strong enough and suggests that we just need to refine this argument slightly.

<p>

The obvious refinement is that the diameter is slightly less than 2. In fact, it is a long diagonal of the polygon, length 2 cos(&pi;/(4n+2)). So we need to show that cos(&pi;/(4n+2)) &lt; 1 - &alpha;/n<sup>2</sup> for some positive &alpha;.

<p>

But it is easy to show that cos x &lt; 1 - x<sup>2</sup>/8 for 0 &lt; x &lt; &pi;/2 and so the result follows.
