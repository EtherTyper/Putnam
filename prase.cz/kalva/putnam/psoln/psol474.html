<b>Problem A4</b><br>

<p>

Take the x-axis as horizontal and the y-axis as vertical. A gun at the origin can fire at any angle into the first quadrant (x, y &ge; 0) with a fixed muzzle velocity v. Assuming the only force on the pellet after firing is gravity (acceleration g), which points in the first quadrant can the gun hit?

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Let the angle of the gun to the x-axis be &theta;. Then the equations of motion are: x = t v cos &theta;, y = t v sin &theta; - 1/2 g t<sup>2</sup>. So the pellet moves along the parabola y = x tan &theta; - x<sup>2</sup> g/2v<sup>2</sup> sec<sup>2</sup>&theta; (*).

<p>

We can view (*) as an equation for &theta; given x, y. Put k = tan &theta;, then the equation becomes g/2v<sup>2</sup> x<sup>2</sup> k<sup>2</sup> - x k + y + gx<sup>2</sup>/2v<sup>2</sup>. This has real roots iff x<sup>2</sup> &ge; 2g/v<sup>2</sup> x<sup>2</sup>y - g<sup>2</sup>/v<sup>4</sup> x<sup>4</sup> and hence iff y &le; 2g<sup>2</sup>/v<sup>2</sup> - x<sup>2</sup>/v<sup>4</sup> x<sup>2</sup> (**). Since x &ge; 0, we see directly from the quadratic that the sum and the product of the roots are both non-negative, so (**) is the condition for the equation to have at least one non-negative root in k and hence at least one root for &theta; in the range 0 to &pi;/2. Thus the gun can hit points in the first quadrant under (or on) the parabola given by (**).
