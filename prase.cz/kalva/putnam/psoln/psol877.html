<b>Problem B1</b><br>

<p>

Evaluate &int;<sub>2</sub><sup>4</sup> ln<sup>1/2</sup>(9 - x)/( ln<sup>1/2</sup>(9 - x) + ln<sup>1/2</sup>(x + 3) ) dx.

<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

Answer: 1.

<p>

<i>Offputting, but easy!</i>

<p>

The integrand looks horrible. A little playing around, differentiating things like ln<sup>1/2</sup>(9 - x), soon confirms this impression. But we know the first question in each Putnam session is always easy, so there must be some trick!

<p>
We might notice that as x goes from 2 to 4, 9 - x goes from 7 to 5, and x + 3 goes from 5 to 7. That might suggest substituting y such that 9 - y = x + 3 (and hence also y + 3 = 9 - x). dy = - dx, the limits interchange and we get &int;<sub>2</sub><sup>4</sup> ln<sup>1/2</sup>(y + 3)/( ln<sup>1/2</sup>(9 - y) + ln<sup>1/2</sup>(y + 3) ) dy. We are home, because we can add the two integrals to get &int;<sub>2</sub><sup>4</sup> 1 dx = 2.
