<b>Problem B6</b><br>

<p>

Four distinct points A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub> have the property that any circle through A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> has at least one point in common with any circle through B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub>. Show that the four points are collinear or lie on a circle.

<p>

&nbsp;<p>

<b>Solution</b><br>

<p>

The trick is to take <i>concentric</i> circles. If A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub> is not parallel to B<sub>1</sub>B<sub>2</sub> then their perpendicular bisectors must intersect at some point O. Take circles centre O through A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub> and through B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>. These must either coincide, in which case the 4 points lie on a circle, or have no points in common.

<p>

In the case where A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub> is parallel to B<sub>1</sub>B<sub>2</sub>. Assume they do not coincide (otherwise the 4 points would be collinear). Then take a point O on the perpendicular bisector of A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub> on the opposite side of A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub> to B<sub>1</sub>B<sub>2</sub> and sufficiently distant from A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub> that the circle through A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub> centre O only extends less than halfway towards the line B<sub>1</sub>B<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, take a circle through B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub> which extends less than halfway towards A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>. Then these circles will not meet.
