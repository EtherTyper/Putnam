<h1>Putnam preparations, 2014</h1>

<p>
UT Students who want to prepare for the Putnam competition -- and even 
those who just want to learn some mathematics or have fun trying hard
problems! -- are invited to join us for weekly practices during the
Fall term. We meet Thursday evenings at 5:30, working on problems for
an hour or so until we stop for free pizza; then we stick around for
another hour or so discussing our solutions and talking about related
bits of mathematics and strategies for attacking these kinds of problems.

<p>Students are encouraged to write up their solutions, too. You can
bring your solutions to me so we can discuss how to improve your
presentation, or you can send them to me to be posted here for the
benefit of other students -- and to encourage others to give you feedback!

<p>Here are the problem sets we've worked on so far.
<ol>
<li><a href="week1.pdf">Some "easy" (hah!) Putnam problems</a> (Oct 2)
<li><a href="week2.pdf">Challenging calculus problems</a> (from old Bennett competitions) (Oct 9)
<li><a href="week3.pdf">More calculus-based problems</a>, some Putnams and some not. Note: problem 1 makes no sense; please ignore. (Oct 16)
<li><a href="week4.pdf">Number Theory problems</a> of varying levels of difficulty; choose yer poison! (Oct 30)
<li><a href="week5.pdf">Linear Algebra problems</a> of varying levels of difficulty, with a Number Theory chaser (Nov 7, with typos corrected.)
<li><a href="week6.pdf">Abstract Algebra problems</a> (Nov 13). For those without an Abstract Algebra background I included a few other problems too.
<li><a href="week7.pdf">Geometry problems</a> (Nov 20).
<li>There will be no meeting Nov 27. Happy Thanksgiving!
<li><a href="week8.pdf">Problems about games</a>, most of them from old Putnam contests (Dec 4)
<!-- <li>You may also want to see <a href="contest">the questions from the contest itself</a> (Dec 6) -->
</ol>

<p>Here is a <a href="sample.pdf">Mock Putnam Exam</a> that I lifted from the internet for you to prep with in the final days. Have fun!

<p>The exam itself is Saturday, Dec 6 at 9am in WCH 1.120. Be there!!

<p>P.S.: I played with the games in the last problem set we worked on. A simple game like "nim" can already be challenging! In question 1b, try replacing
M with the set {1,6,14}; the starting values of N which are a win for the first player depend only on the residue of N modulo 22, but that only applies
for N > 36 ! (That is, N=36 gives the opposite conclusion from N=36+22, and the same can be said of a few other values of N smaller than 36.) I don't
know the right solution in general !
