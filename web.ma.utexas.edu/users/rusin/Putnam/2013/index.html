Welcome to the U.T. Putnam-2013 prep page!

<p>The Putnam competition will be Dec 7 2013<!-- in RLM 10.176-->,
We will start promptly at 9 so please arrive a little before then to settle
down. Bring a writing implement; nothing else is necessary nor allowed!


<p>We will be holding "review sessions" once a week to get ready for
the Putnam exam this year. We meet Thursdays at 5:30 in RLM 10.176.
Every week we will try some new problems, talk about the mathematics
involved in them, and share our ideas and solutions. We have
pizza and soda delivered so you have plenty of energy to continue until
7 at least. (Some people stick around longer to talk and/or work on the
problems.)

<p>Each week I will put the questions here. I would also like to put
up solutions but I want YOU to give them to me! If you see a problem up
here with no solution attached, you should treat it as still open and
give it a shot. The prep questions will vary in difficulty; some of them
are actual Putnam exam questions from years past.

<p>The first question is the one I asked faculty members to mention
in class in order to tempt students to come join us:
<b>How many primes are there whose usual base-10 representation
         is a strictly alternating sequence of 1's and 0's? (Example: 101)</b>
As of this writing this question is still open...

<p>Here are the problem sets I have handed out each week; we usually discuss
the solutions the following week. I have also posted here some solutions as I
get them. (Send me more! You should practice writing things up!)

<li><a href="wk1.pdf">Sept 26</a>.
<li><a href="wk2.pdf">Oct 3</a>. 
<li><a href="wk3.pdf">Oct 10</a>.
<li><a href="wk4.pdf">Oct 17</a>.
I got curious and wrote up an <a href="int1.pdf">alternate solution</a>
to problem 1. I also wrote up an example of the <a href="roots.pdf">
root-finding method</a> I mentioned in connection with problem 5.
<li><a href="wk5.pdf">Oct 24</a>. 
I mentioned an application of this "positive iff sum-of-squares" theme,
so here is an instance of this idea: proving the
<a href=SOS.pdf>Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Inequality</a>
<li><a href="wk6.pdf">Oct 31</a>. 
We didn't finish explaining how to win the bean game but I liked the question
and <a href="beangame.pdf">answered</a> (a generalized form of) it.
<li><a href="wk7.pdf">Nov  7</a>. Billy Swartworth sent me a full solution of
<a href="w7-4.pdf">Problem 4</a>
<li><a href="wk8.pdf">Nov 14</a>.
<li><a href="wk9.pdf">Nov 21</a>.
<li><a href="p.pdf">Dec  5</a>  -- this week our problem set was simply an
old Putnam exam: an unvarnished chance to experience the exam itself.
</ol>

<!-- 
<li> We will continue to meet weekly (except Thanksgiving) until December 5. So, yet to come are:
-->

<p>Thanks for your interest! Save the first Saturday in December for the
Putnam exam, year after year :-)
