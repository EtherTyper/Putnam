Welcome to the U.T. Putnam-2010 prep page!
This lame excuse for a web page will be a place to share problems and
solutions, as well as announcements.

<p>The 2010 exam is now history. A good time was had by all :-) . Please
join us taking the Putnam exam in 2011. The official problem set is
posted on the door of RLM 9.140. Unofficial copies of the problems, and
various proposed solutions, can be found on the net. <a href="putnam.2010">Here</a> are my solutions to most of the questions.

<p>If you want to take the Putnam exam some day, it is good to practice
thinking about the questions, and writing up your solutions. You are welcome
to continue thinking about the problems below; new solutions received from
students will be posted here as received.

<p>
Here are links to all the problem handouts.
<ol>
<li> <a href="handout1.pdf">Oct 05 2010.</a> Note that problem #1 makes no sense at all; ignore
<li> <a href="handout2.pdf">Oct 12 2010.</a>
<li> <a href="handout3.pdf">Oct 19 2010.</a> You may have gotten a copy with the minus signs missing in problem 1; there are four of them to the right of the brace
<li> <a href="handout4.pdf">Oct 26 2010.</a>
<li> <a href="handout5.pdf">Nov 02 2010.</a>
<li> <a href="handout6.pdf">Nov 09 2010.</a>
<li> <a href="handout7.pdf">Nov 16 2010.</a>
<li> <a href="handout8.pdf">Nov 30 2010.</a> We also discussed one additional
problem from an old Putnam exam: if a binary operation on a set <i>S</i>
satisfies the relations <i>x*(x*y)=y</i> and <i>(y*x)*x=y</i> for all
<i>x,y</i> in <i>S</i>, show that the operation is commutative (but that
it need not be associative). 
</ol>

<p>I will put solutions proposed by the group up here as I receive them.
Let's go guys -- bring in some solutions so they can be posted! I know
we have seen solutions to all the problems to set #5; I am posting a
solution to the one I solved with the group (#1) -- how about you?
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="p1-2.pdf">Week #1, Problem #2</a>
<li> Week #1, Problem #3, <a href="p1-3-a.pdf">page1</a> and <a href="p1-3-b.pdf">page2</a>
<li> <a href="p1-4.pdf">Week #1, Problem #4</a>
<li> <a href="p1-5.pdf">Week #1, Problem #5</a>
<li> <a href="p2-1.pdf">Week #2, Problem #1</a>
<li> <a href="p2-4.pdf">Week #2, Problem #4</a>
<li> <a href="p2-5.pdf">Week #2, Problem #5</a>
<li> Week #3, Problem #1, <a href="p3-1-a.pdf">page1</a> and <a href="p3-1-b.pdf">page2</a>
<li> <a href="p3-3.pdf">Week #3, Problem #3</a> One of you has presented a more detailed (and, I think, more correct) solution <a href="PP/">here</a>. (You can try the microsoft .doc formats if you want but only the .html file worked for me.)
<li> <a href="p4-1.pdf">Week #4, Problem #1</a>
<li> <a href="p4-2.doc">Week #4, Problem #2</a>
<li> <a href="p4-4.pdf">Week #4, Problem #4</a> I had a lot of fun playing the game and analyzing it. You might want to read half my solution (pg.1) and then see if you can devise the winning strategy yourself, based on what I found with
some computer help!
<li> <a href="p5-1.pdf">Week #5, Problem #1</a>
<li> <a href="p6-2.pdf">Week #6, Problem #2</a>
<li> <a href="p6-6.pdf">Week #6, Problem #6</a>
<li> <a href="p8-5.pdf">Week #8, Problem #5</a>
<li> <a href="p8-6.pdf">Week #8, Problem #6</a> (The additional problem
summarized above)
</ul>

<p>Thanks for your interest! Save the first Saturday in December for the
Putnam exam, year after year :-)
