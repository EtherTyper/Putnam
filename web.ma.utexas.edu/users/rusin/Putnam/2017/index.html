<h1>Putnam preparations, 2017</h1>

<p>First read more about the Putnam competition on this page's <a href="..">parent page</a>

<p>This year's UT Putnam competition will take place at 9am on Dec 2, 2017 in <i>RLM 5.124</i>

<p><b>UPDATE</b> The exam is over and it was a lot of fun! We had 20 student participants
and I heard a lot of good answers being discussed. I fleshed out some of the ideas I heard
(and my own thoughts) and wrote up some <a href="rusin2017a.pdf">answers</a> to about 3/4
of the questions over the exam weekend. (With <a href="fwiw.pdf">addenda</a> .)

<p>
UT Students who want to prepare for the Putnam competition -- and even 
those who just want to learn some mathematics or have fun trying hard
problems! -- are invited to join us for weekly practices during the
Fall term. We meet MONDAY evenings at 5:00 in RLM 10.176, working on problems
for an hour or so until we stop for free pizza; then we stick around for
another hour or so discussing our solutions and talking about related
bits of mathematics and strategies for attacking these kinds of problems.
Your faculty Putnam Team this year consists of Dave Rusin and Dennis Eichhorn.

<p>Students are encouraged to write up their solutions, too. You can
bring your solutions to me so we can discuss how to improve your
presentation, or you can send them to me to be posted here for the
benefit of other students -- and to encourage others to give you feedback!

<p>Here are the problem sets we've worked on so far.
<ol>
 <li> At our first meeting we tried a hodge-podge of <a href="2016-1.pdf">interesting problems</a>. I wrote up an answer for <a href="2016-1a.pdf">the last question</a> and some comments about a few of the others.
 <li> Sept 25 we worked on problems using <a href="2017-2.pdf">Induction and the Pigeonhole Principle</a>.
I've written up <a href="2017-2a.pdf">some solutions</a> but welcome yours!
 <li> Oct   2 was about                   <a href="2017-3.pdf">Calculus Problems</a>
Here is 
<a href="2017-3d.pdf">Rusin's solution</a> to problem 4,
a <a href="2017-3a.pdf">student solution</a> to problem 7, and <a href="2017-3b.pdf">Dennis Eichhorn's</a> solution to number 8.
 <li> Oct   9 we worked on some           <a href="2017-4.pdf">Linear Algebra Problems</a>.
I had time to write up <a href="2017-4b.pdf">some solutions</a>.
I brought along some additional questions that day in case anyone wanted more;
here is a good <a href="2017-4a.pdf">solution to one of these extra problems</a> sent by a student.
<li> Oct  16 was all about                   <a href="2017-5.pdf">Number Theory    </a> (Typo in #7: for "sum" read "sum of the squares of").   Here are Rusin's <a href="2017-5a.pdf">solutions</a>.
<li>On  Oct  23 we looked at some questions using <a href="2017-6.pdf">Combinatorics</a> <!-- Here are Rusin's <a href="2017-6a.pdf">solutions</a>.-->
<li>Oct 30 = <a href="2017-7.pdf">Probability</a>
<li>On Nov 6 we tried some questions from  <a href="2017-8.pdf">Group Theory</a> which is tricky because many or even most of the students had never had a group theory class; so this problem set includes a quick miniature introduction to the subject. I have now written up a complete set of <a href="2017-8a.pdf">answers</a> to help neophytes learn some group-theory thinking before the Putnam!
<li>Nov 13 = <a href="2017-9.pdf">Geometry</a>
<li>On Nov 20 I gave students a  <a href="2017-10.pdf">hodge-podge</a> of topics from all areas of mathematics. (Well, apparently I skipped both Probability and Linear Algebra; sorry about that.) I haven't finished writing out
all my answers, but <a href="2017-10a.pdf">here</a> are the ones I've done so far.
<li>On Nov 27 we tried our hand at an actual Putnam Exam! (Part A from 2013). You can find the questions and
solutions on line if you like.

</ol>


The exam is THIS Saturday, Dec 2. The exam takes place in 
RLM 5.124 . We have the room at 8:30; get settled and ready to
fill in the paperwork so we can start the actual problem solving at
9am. See you there!
