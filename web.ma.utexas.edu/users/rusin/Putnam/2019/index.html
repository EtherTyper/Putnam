<h1>U.T. Putnam preparations, 2019</h1>

<p>First read more about the Putnam competition on this page's <a href="..">parent page</a>


<p>This year's UT Putnam competition will take place at 9am on Dec 7, 2019. 
<!--  I don't have a location yet but will post it here when I do. -->
in <i>RLM 9.166</i>.
<!--
 I have also reserved RLM 10.166 for overflow crowds.
-->

<p>
UT Students who want to prepare for the Putnam competition -- and even 
those who just want to learn some mathematics or have fun trying hard
problems! -- are invited to join us for weekly practices during the
Fall term. We meet 
THURSDAY evenings at 5:00 in RLM 9.166, (starting Sept 26) 
working on problems
for an hour or so until we stop for free pizza; then we stick around for
another hour or so discussing our solutions and talking about related
bits of mathematics and strategies for attacking these kinds of problems.

<p>Students are encouraged to write up their solutions, too. You can
bring your solutions to me so we can discuss how to improve your
presentation, or you can send them to me to be posted here for the
benefit of other students -- and to encourage others to give you feedback!

<p>I will post the problems we work on each week right here.
I can also post solutions to the problems but what I would prefer to do is
to have some of YOU submit write-ups to solutions that you have worked out!
Get them to me and I will post them.


<p>Here are the problem sets we've worked on so far.
<ol>
 <li> At our first meeting we worked on last year's <a href="2019-1.pdf">Bennet Competition problems</a>.
      These are calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations problems;
      most of them are quite tricky!
      Some solutions were presented by students at our prep session;
      if you want to see my solutions and commentary you can head over to
      the <a href="http://math.utexas.edu/~rusin/Bennett">Bennett Competition page</a>
      and look at the answer keys for the Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 exams.

 <li> Week 2 (Oct 3) is for <a href="2019-2.pdf">Number Theory</a> (by popular demand!) I have not written up solutions; perhaps you would like to provide some? (I did type up <a href="ans2.pdf">a few answers</a>

 <li> Week 3 (Oct 10) --- you requested fancy Calculus question; <a href="2019-3.pdf">here you go!</a> (Some are actual Putnam problems!) Ethan Jana has provided <a href="Jana-3.pdf">answers to some of the questions</a> (numbers 2,3, and 6)

 <li> Week 4 (Oct 17) --- all kinds of <a href="2019-4.pdf">Geometry!</a>. I had time to
write up a few of the <a href="ans4.pdf">answers</a>

<li> Week 5 (Oct 24) was an introduction to <a href="2019-5.pdf">Abstract Algebrai</a>, but I will also
have a few randomly-chosen problems from other subjects, for those who have no idea what
"Abstract Algebra" even means! I haven't written up solutions except for <a href="ans5-3">Problem 3</a>,
which seemed to annoy many of the students. <a href="nickell_10_24_19.pdf">Liam Nickell</a> also sent in
a solution; his is more symmetrical!

<li> Week 6 (Oct 31) was for <a href="2019-6.pdf">Combinatorics</a>. I got some solutions from
<a href="blount_Comb__Problem_4.pdf">William Blount (#4)</a> and <a href="kim_combo_sols.pdf">Luis Kim (#1, #5)</a>
which seem to check out. (I had already written up my own solution to problem 1,
together of what I remembered of Luis's, <a href="ans6.pdf">here</a>.)

<li> Week 7 (Nov 7) we did <a href="2019-7.pdf">Linear Algebra</a>. I jotted down the ideas behind
the <a href="ans7.pdf">solutions</a> of a few of them.

<li> Week 8 (Nov 14) we did <a href="2019-8.pdf">Functional Equations and Inequalities</a> 
There were some typos; I think this version fixes them. Again I sketched <a href="ans8.pdf">a few solutions</a>

<li> Week 9 (Nov 21) was just playing games! Well, not really playing them but <a href="2019-9.pdf">analyzing them</a>.
I think we had solutions to most of them. Here's <a href="ans9.pdf">a solutioni</a> to just one.

<li> Nov 28 is Thanksgiving --- there will be no meeting. 

<li> Week 10 (Dec 5) is just two days before the Putnam Exam itself. We will try solving an actual Putnam exam from years gone by.

</ol>

The exam itself is Saturday, Dec 7. We will use RLM 9.166. (I have an overflow room if we need it.) Please try to arrive by
8:45am so we can take care of paperwork and then start at 9. First session is 9am to noon; then we'll go out to lunch and
come back in time for the second session of 6 more questions, from 2pm to 5pm. Bring something to write with. You don't need
much else.

<!--
The exam is THIS Saturday, Dec 1. The exam takes place in 
RLM 5.124 and RLM 9.166. We have the rooms at 8:30; get settled and ready to
fill in the paperwork so we can start the actual problem solving at
9am. See you there!

<p><b>AN ANSWER OR TWO</b>
<ul>
<li><a href="a1.pdf">A1</a>
<li><a href="a2.pdf">A2</a>
<li><a href="a3.pdf">A3</a>
<li><a href="a4.pdf">A4</a>
<li><a href="a5.pdf">A5</a> comments (no solution)
<li><a href="a6.pdf">A6</a>

<li><a href="b1.pdf">B1</a> 
<li>B2: No real idea. It may help to write the polynomials in a different way
to get rid of all the n's. Note (1-z)f = n-(z+z^2+...+z^n), for example, or
(1-z)^2f = n - (n+1) z + z^(n+1). But now simple inequalities are likely
to be useless because (1-z)f DOES get small on the closed disk!
<li><a href="b2.pdf">B2</a> 
<li><a href="b3.pdf">B3</a>
<li><a href="b4.pdf">B4</a>
<li><a href="b5.pdf">B5</a>
<li>B6: no clue
