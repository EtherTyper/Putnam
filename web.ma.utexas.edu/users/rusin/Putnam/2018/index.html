<h1>U.T. Putnam preparations, 2018</h1>

<b>UPDATE: The 2018 Putnam was great -- 23 students showed up to take it at UT, more than any other year this century! Thank you all for coming. I hope to put up my solutions to a few of the problems at the bottom of this page. See you all in 2019! --- dave</B>

<p>

<p>First read more about the Putnam competition on this page's <a href="..">parent page</a>

<p>This year's UT Putnam competition will take place at 9am on Dec 1, 2018 in <i>RLM 9.166</i>. I have also reserved RLM 5.124 for overflow crowds.

<p>
UT Students who want to prepare for the Putnam competition -- and even 
those who just want to learn some mathematics or have fun trying hard
problems! -- are invited to join us for weekly practices during the
Fall term. We meet THURSDAY evenings at 5:00 in RLM 9.166, working on problems
for an hour or so until we stop for free pizza; then we stick around for
another hour or so discussing our solutions and talking about related
bits of mathematics and strategies for attacking these kinds of problems.

<p>Students are encouraged to write up their solutions, too. You can
bring your solutions to me so we can discuss how to improve your
presentation, or you can send them to me to be posted here for the
benefit of other students -- and to encourage others to give you feedback!

<p>Here are the problem sets we've worked on so far.
<ol>
 <li> At our first meeting we worked on last year's <a href="2018-1.pdf">Bennet Competition problems</a>.
      All of these are calculus problems; most of them are quite tricky!
      Some solutions were presented by students at our prep session;
      if you want to see my solutions and commentary you can head over to
      the <a href="http://math.utexas.edu/~rusin/Bennett">Bennett Competition page</a>
      and look at the answer keys for the Fall 2017 and Spring 2018 exams.
 <li> Week 2 (Sept 27) is for <a href="2018-2.pdf">Number Theory</a> (by popular demand!)
      I have written up an <a href="2018-2a.pdf">answer key</a> except for
      the last question, which, actually, no one on the planet has yet answered!
      I wrote up a (long) separate discussion of the importance of that
      <a href="2018-2x.pdf">last number theory question</a> to entice you to
      do some research along those lines!
 <li> Week 3 (Oct 4) we discussed Geometry. Here are the <a href="2018-3.pdf">questions</a>, and
      here is a student-submitted <a href="2018-3-1.jpeg">answer to question 1</a>
 <li> Week 4, Oct 11, I gave problems that were (mostly) about <a href="2018-4.pdf">Linear Algebra.</a>
 <li> Week 5, Oct 18, we played games! <a href="2018-5-1.pdf">page1</a> <a href="2018-5-2.pdf">page2</a> (More precisely we analyzed some abstract games) By the way, I mentioned a game I had played as a kid and by chance stumbled upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KABcmczPdg">this video</a> the next day, that displays it and discusses the logic of it!
 <li> Week 6, Oct 25, was about <a href="2018-6.pdf">Probability.</a> I think we answered all the questions! Here are the <a href="2018-6a.pdf">answers</a>, which I turned into a mini-lesson.
 <li> Week 7, Nov  1, was about <a href="2018-7.pdf">Combinatorics.</a> 
 <li> Week 8, Nov  8, was about <a href="2018-8.pdf">Functional Equations,</a> including differential equations
 <li> Week 9, Nov 15, we discussed some of the topics in more advanced classes that occasionally show up in Putnam problems (or, more often, in their solutions!) I had separate handouts in <a href="2018-9.pdf">Group Theory</a> and stole some others from the web: <a href="putnamanal.pdf">this</a> and <a href="t05.pdf">this</a>, so there are plenty of problems for you to work on!
 <li> We will not meet on Thanksgiving (Nov 22)
 <li> There will be one last meeting on Nov 29, just two days before the Putnam exam, when all topics will be on the table and we will talk about strategies to be used on competition day. (We used the day to try an actual Putnam session -- <a href="https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/2014.pdf">the B session from 2014.</a>)

</ol>


The exam is THIS Saturday, Dec 1. The exam takes place in 
RLM 5.124 and RLM 9.166. We have the rooms at 8:30; get settled and ready to
fill in the paperwork so we can start the actual problem solving at
9am. See you there!

<p><b>AN ANSWER OR TWO</b>
<ul>
<li><a href="a1.pdf">A1</a>
<li><a href="a2.pdf">A2</a>
<li><a href="a3.pdf">A3</a>
<li><a href="a4.pdf">A4</a>
<li><a href="a5.pdf">A5</a> comments (no solution)
<li><a href="a6.pdf">A6</a>

<li><a href="b1.pdf">B1</a> 
<li>B2: No real idea. It may help to write the polynomials in a different way
to get rid of all the n's. Note (1-z)f = n-(z+z^2+...+z^n), for example, or
(1-z)^2f = n - (n+1) z + z^(n+1). But now simple inequalities are likely
to be useless because (1-z)f DOES get small on the closed disk!
<!-- <li><a href="b2.pdf">B2</a>--> 
<li><a href="b3.pdf">B3</a>
<li><a href="b4.pdf">B4</a>
<li><a href="b5.pdf">B5</a>
<li>B6: no clue
