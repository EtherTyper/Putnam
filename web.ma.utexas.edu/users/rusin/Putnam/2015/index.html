<h1>Putnam preparations, 2015</h1>

<p>
UT Students who want to prepare for the Putnam competition -- and even 
those who just want to learn some mathematics or have fun trying hard
problems! -- are invited to join us for weekly practices during the
Fall term. We meet Monday evenings at 5:00, working on problems for
an hour or so until we stop for free pizza; then we stick around for
another hour or so discussing our solutions and talking about related
bits of mathematics and strategies for attacking these kinds of problems.

<p>Students are encouraged to write up their solutions, too. You can
bring your solutions to me so we can discuss how to improve your
presentation, or you can send them to me to be posted here for the
benefit of other students -- and to encourage others to give you feedback!

<p>Here are the problem sets we've worked on so far.
<ol>
<li>A <a href="week1.pdf">random assortment of Putnam-like problems.</a>
 <ul>
 <li>I wrote up a <a href="wk1-7.pdf">solution to problem 3</a>
 </ul>
<li>Some <a href="week2.pdf">calculus-based problems</a>
 <ul>
 <li>Dean M sent in a <a href="wk2-6.jpg">solution to problem 6</a> which I <a href="wk2-6.pdf">generalized</a> just a little.
 </ul>
<li>Some problems of a <a href="week3.pdf">combinatorial</a> nature.
 <ul>
 <li>Student solution to the determinant game <a href="wk3a.pdf">page 1</a>, <a href="wk3b.pdf">page 2</a>
 <li>I wanted to expand a couple of things I said about <a href="wk3-1.pdf">the first two questions</a>
 </ul>
<li>Week 4: <a href="week4.pdf">Geometry!</a>
 <ul>
 <li>Responses to <a href="wk4-1.pdf">a couple of geometry questions</a>
 </ul>
<li>Week 5: <a href="week5.pdf">Number Theory</a>. All of these are actual Putnam questions!
 <ul>
 <li><a href="wk5a.pdf">Answers</a> to the problems that were presented at the session.
 <li><a href="wk5b.pdf">Problem 4</a> -- Tam's answer
 </ul>
<li>Week 6: <a href="week6.pdf">Linear Algebra and Differential Equations</a>
<li><i>Note: I will not hold a review session on Nov 23rd. (You are welcome to gather anyway, if you'd like to pick your own problems!)</i>
<li>Week 7: We all worked on an <a href="http://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/2010.pdf">actual Putnam exam!</a> (some worked set A, orthers set B). 
 <ul>
 <li>Some thoughts on <a href="wk71.pdf">B1</a>
 </ul>

<!--
<li><a href="week2.pdf">Challenging calculus problems</a> (from old Bennett competitions) (Oct 9)
<li><a href="week3.pdf">More calculus-based problems</a>, some Putnams and some not. Note: problem 1 makes no sense; please ignore. (Oct 16)
<li><a href="week4.pdf">Number Theory problems</a> of varying levels of difficulty; choose yer poison! (Oct 30)
<li><a href="week5.pdf">Linear Algebra problems</a> of varying levels of difficulty, with a Number Theory chaser (Nov 7, with typos corrected.)
<li><a href="week6.pdf">Abstract Algebra problems</a> (Nov 13). For those without an Abstract Algebra background I included a few other problems too.
<li><a href="week7.pdf">Geometry problems</a> (Nov 20).
<li>There will be no meeting Nov 27. Happy Thanksgiving!
<li><a href="week8.pdf">Problems about games</a>, most of them from old Putnam contests (Dec 4)
<li>You may also want to see <a href="contest">the questions from the contest itself</a> (Dec 6)

<!--
<p>Here is a <a href="sample.pdf">Mock Putnam Exam</a> that I lifted from the internet for you to prep with in the final days. Have fun!
-->

The exam is THIS Saturday, Dec 5. The exam takes place in our practice room: RLM 9.166 . We have the room at 8:30; get settled and ready to fill in the paperwork so we can start the actual problem solving at 9am. See you there!

Dave Rusin in RLM 9.140.
