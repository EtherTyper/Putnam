Welcome to the U.T. Putnam-2012 prep page!

<p><blink> NEW!</b> The Putnam competition will be Dec 1 2012 in RLM 10.176.
We will start promptly at 9 so please arrive a little before then to settle
down. Bring a writing implement; nothing else is necessary nor allowed!


<p>We will be holding "review sessions" once a week to get ready for
the Putnam exam this year. We meet Thursdays at 5:30 in RLM 10.176.
Every week we will try some new problems, talk about the mathematics
involved in them, and share our ideas and solutions. We have
pizza and soda delivered so you have plenty of energy to continue until
7 at least. (Some people stick around longer to talk and/or work on the
problems.)

<p>Each week I will put the questions here. I would also like to put
up solutions but I want YOU to give them to me! If you see a problem up
here with no solution attached, you should treat it as still open and
give it a shot. The prep questions will vary in difficulty; some of them
are actual Putnam exam questions from years past.

<p>The first question is the one I asked faculty members to mention
in class in order to tempt students to come join us:
<b>How many primes are there whose usual base-10 representation
         is a strictly alternating sequence of 1's and 0's? (Example: 101)</b>
As of this writing this question is still open...

<p>Here are the problem sets I have handed out each week; we usually discuss
the solutions the following week. I have also posted here some solutions as I
get them. (Send me more! You should practice writing things up!)
<ol>
<li><a href="wk1.pdf">Sept 13</a>. Solutions received: <a href="w1-1.pdf">#1</a>. <a href="w1-4.pdf">#4 (partial)</a>. 
Problem 5 is still open
<li><a href="wk2.pdf">Sept 20</a>. Solutions have been presented in the group
to all of the questions (more or less) but I have not gotten any written-up 
solutions...
<li><a href="wk3.pdf">Sept 27</a>. We worked out all of these together on Oct 4.
(BTW #4 was the B1 problem from 1991)
<li><a href="wk4.pdf">Oct 4</a>. Problem 4 will be discussed again Oct 18.
<li><a href="wk5.pdf">Oct 11</a>. These we will discuss Oct 18 as well, along
with a <a href="tribe.pdf">special bonus puzzler!</a>. You might find it useful
to review this <a href="LA.pdf">Linear Algebra primer</a> which I have shamelessly
swiped from the web. I have typed up a <a href="w5-1.pdf">solution to question 1</a>
<li>No new questions handed out Oct 18 -- need to catch up!
<li><a href="wk6.pdf">Oct 25</a> problems (due Nov 1)
<li><a href="wk7.pdf">Nov. 1</a> problems (due Nov 8)
<li><a href="wk8.pdf">Nov. 8</a> problems (due Nov 15) We all worked hard on problem
number 2; I had to do a literature search to learn what's up. It's very interesting!
I leave you with a <a href="w8-2.pdf">description of the answer</a> and a
<a href="w8-2.gif">picture of a dissected unit diamond</a>
<li>Olena provided a set of questions on probability for Nov 15 but I don't have
a copy to post here. I did prepare <a href="wk9.pdf">one last set of problems</a>
covering other topics we have not yet discussed.
<li> We meet one last time Nov 29. 
</ol>

<p>
So far we have discussed the problems and used those as a springboard to
talk about theorems in calculus (integrals, series), analytic geometry,
and number theory. We'll continue to discuss these topics and move on
to geometry, differential equations, linear algebra, and advanced topics
(group theory, topology, etc.) Please let me know what you're interest in
trying!

<p>Thanks for your interest! Save the first Saturday in December for the
Putnam exam, year after year :-)
